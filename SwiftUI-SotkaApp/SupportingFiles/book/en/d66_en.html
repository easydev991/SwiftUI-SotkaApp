During this week we are going to get you familiar with advanced exercises, the ones which are the foundation of Street Workout subculture. All this information is given for you in order to open your mind to bodyweight training and calisthenics, and, by default, we don't expect you to use these new exercises during SOTKA program. Let's say it is a reserve for the your future trainings. And the exercise we are going to discuss today is:<br><br>


<h3>Dips</h3><br>

<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">IMPORTANT!!</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">The information in this infopost is given for consideration only and for your overall awareness (don’t forget we are having an education program). We recommend using it AFTER a finishing our 100 Days Workout programm.</div></div><br><br>


<img src="../img/66-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


This is one of the key (together with pull-ups, push-ups, and squats) exercises in Street Workout culture, which involves a lot of muscles and joints in our body and aims to train strength and size of the chest and arms muscles (first of all, tricepses).<br><br>


<h3>Key points</h3><br>


1. The more movement amplitude is, the more muscles are involved in the process<br>
2. When doing push-ups, your muscles of hands, back, abdomen, and legs should be tense<br>
3. To achieve maximum result, you should move down slowly, but push up quickly (but smooth)<br>
4. You push up with the strength of your chest, hand muscles, only in this way<br>
5. You should exhale when moving down and inhale for moving up<br><br>


<h3>Safety technique</h3><br>


Chest dips could be quite a high-injury exercise for a beginner (if you are doing it wrong, you are likely to have traumas of elbows, shoulders, shoulder blades, collar bone, wrists), therefore you should follow the recommendations below in an appropriate technique:<br><br>


1. The whole move should be perfomed in natural trajectory<br>
2. Movement should be 100% controlled (!!!)<br>
3. No bursts, abrupt movements, and body bounces<br>
4. Don’t bring your head up, don’t lower it too much, look in front of you or a bit below<br>
5. If you feel that something is going wrong, stop doing the exercise, have a rest and try another way of doing it (for example, narrower/wider bars, another amplitude of movement, another angle of body bent, etc.)<br><br>


The exercise can be divided into 4 elements:<br><br>


1. Hold the body at arms length above the bars (the bars should be wider than the shoulder width)<br>
2. Lower your body by bending arms in elbows<br>
3. Pause at the lowest point<br>
4. Return to the initial position by unbending arms in elbows<br><br>

				
				
<h3>Easier variations</h3><br>


If right now you can’t do chest dips fully, then we could recommend doing more push-ups with a greater amplitude, if possible (with the support for the push-ups or on the bars).<br><br>


<h3>Useful advices</h3><br>


<b>Starting position</b>. You’d better start with the arms straightened on the bars, that is from the upper point rather than from the lower point. This is especially important so for the beginners. Because upper position is less dangerous than the low one.<br><br>


<b>Bar width</b>. This is an unregulated factor (especially when you don’t have a lot of choice in training locations) which influences the exertion, trained muscles, and the injury risk. A general rule states that wider bars are used to train chest muscle, while narrow bars are to be used to train triceps. However, you should remember that the bars must be comfortable for you. Unfortunately, I came across a lot of training sites with the bars which are too wide (in rare cases they are too narrow), therefore you definitely can’t do the chest dips in the right way, and if you try to do the exercise with a half amplitude, you are likely to be under the risk of injury of a shoulder joint.<br><br>


Therefore, we want to pay your attention to the fact that it must be comfortable for you to do chest dips with the right amplitude. Otherwise, you will consciously or subconsciously try to change the technique in a way to achieve this comfort by reducing the efficiency of the exercise and by increasing the risk of being injured.<br><br>


<b>Gravity</b>. Chest dips are far more difficult exercise than push-ups, therefore gravity force pulls your body to the ground, and you should be held by your arms only, which can result in injuries in shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints with no appropriate prior training or to the stretches and injuries of muscles.<br><br>


That's why:<br><br>


1. Study carefully the technique of performing this exercise, start with simple lead-up exercises (hold your arms straightened above the bars, do push-ups at the bars with an incomplete amplitude and so on).<br>
2. ALWAYS control your movements. You must move down with the strength of your muscles and move up with the strength of muscles too. If you feel that you can’t do the next rep perfectly well, you’d better leave the bars and continue training the muscles by push-ups. Believe me, it is quite far from being pleasant to fall from the bars because you don’t have enough strength in your muscles.<br><br>


<b>Different muscles</b>. Chest dips train chest muscles and tricepses by applying different exertions which depend on two factors: body angle and elbow position to the body when it is bent. If you want to exert chest muscles, then you should move the body forward, while the elbows should be bent to the sides. If you want to exert triceps, then the body should be in a straight position, while the elbows should “look” backward rather than to the sides when bent.<br><br>


<b>Range of motion</b>. Some may say that maximum amplitude is a must for maximum efficiency, while others may not agree and work with the medium amplitude. I say that it all depends, and you should try different ways and choose the one that is the most efficient for you!
