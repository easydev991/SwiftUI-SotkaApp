I have already told you that the BASIC block of our programme has more common with general conditioning than with WorkOut movement, but in a few days we will start our ADVANCED block and you will get more information on street specific training. That is why I want to tell you about the workout today.<br><br>


This is first-hand information since I was one of those who were in the game right from the very beginning in the distant year of 2009. So I saw personally how the history was made and took active participation in it. Back then street and school facilities were vacant, very few people exercised on bars and no one could ever have imagined what would happen in the next few years.<br><br>


But first things first.<br><br>


<h3>What does the "Street Workout" mean?</h3><br>


Street Workout - is a street subculture,  which combines unique training approach, inention for versatile personnal development and social activity.<br><br>


As we can see from a definition, there are 3 main parts in Street Workout. And as far as most people associate it only with working out on street playgrounds, let's start with that thing first.<br><br>


It is quite typical that when I give this definition of Street Workout I get questions how it is different from regular calisthenics. I think that the best answer I can muster is to offer you to watch some videos and I hope that they are able to answer the question in the best way possible:<br><br>

Until 2008, when such videos began to appear on YouTube, no one had even come close to offering such an approach to training. Of course, before that moment people did some exercises and elements on the horizontal and parallel bars (mostly borrowed from gymnastics), but there certainly was no creative approach to exercises, combinations and everything else that <b>Bar-tendaz</b>, <b>Ruff Ryders</b> and other teams invented. I want to note that each member of these teams had his own unique style. Training was not only a way to strengthen the body for them, but also a way of self-expression. Why do the same things each time you’re at the sports ground? The same exercises, the same sets? Why limit yourself to a program or a plan? If different spots grounds allow you to do completely different exercises, then why not to use it? In this sense, street training is close in spirit to street dancing.<br><br>


These videos showed that outdoor activities (at the sports grounds or any suitable spots) give excellent results regarding health, strength and beauty of the body without any financial cost and they inspired hundreds of thousands of people around the world to start training. It is worth mentioning once again that workout has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Soviet gymnastics. As you can see, there are no gymnastic exercises in the videos above at all. People, who started this all, were no gymnasts and were not inspired by gymnasts and by what they do. They just did exercises at the sports grounds and shared their experience and knowledge with others. Well, then there were YouTube, Facebook and VKontakte and the speed, with which the ideas of such unusual training spread, has increased many times.<br><br>


Now it is very difficult to find out who exactly started it, but we can definitely say that such famous people as <b>Beast</b> and <b>GIANT</b> were ones of the first, and a little later there were teams <b>Harlem SEALS, Calisthenics Kings, Wingate Family and Bar-Barians</b>. We name those who became known thanks to Internet, but they also learned from someone else. Unfortunately, the names of those people are unknown.<br><br>


It seems like we figured out the subject of the training component, it only should be added that abroad such training is called calisthenics or bodyweight training, and now you can move on.<br><br>


<b><h3>Street Workout history</h3></b><br>


We put the American videos above for a reason, as a new approach to the usual exercises originated in the United States of America. And although many people wrongly identufy it to the inhabitants of poor areas, it was far from reality. People just gathered in parks at the street sports grounds and exercised together. At the sports ground everybody is equal, and the only thing that mattered is that you came to work.<br><br>

In Russia, this new approach to training was learned in the fall of 2008, when several guys from the One More Day team came across the videos above and were impressed not less than you now. Inspired with the spirit of street training, they decided that it was unbelievably cool and they needed not only to start to do it themselves, but also to get so many people as possible familiar with it. The guys themselves engaged in parkour, so they decided to come up with a name for a new tendency. On reflection, they created a group in VK.com called <b>Ghetto Workout</b> (in honor of one of the videos) and began to perform Sunday weekly open-air training for everybody. The idea was precisely to show people that it's possible to become stronger, healthier and more beautiful with the use of imagination and body weight in the mean of resistance.<br><br>


Unlike the above-mentioned American team <b>Bar-tendaz</b>, who organized master-classes, trainings and lectures about healthy lifestyles too, but did it for money, the guys from <b>One More Day</b> did everything absolutely for free and out of sheer enthusiasm. They also tried to show people in other cities that nothing is needed to develop workout, to organize and perform trainings. It's enough just to create a VKontakte group, invite friends and acquaintances and start training. Many cities began to take an example from them and organize their own workout community. Very quickly workout became popular among young people not only across Russia, but also in the CIS countries. So, around the same time, a certain philosophy of this tendency and the spirit of workout began to emerge.<br><br>


Thanks to its availability, interestingness and efficiency, Ghetto Workout and street training gained immense popularity among schoolchildren and students just after a couple of years, and Russia became the world leader in this direction and outperformed significantly all other countries, both in terms of the number involved, and the degree of the infrastructure development. It all started with a few people, their friends and acquaintances. Gradually, the number of people engaged grew, and absolutely new people, who learned about workout from the Internet, came to the open-air trainings and gatherings. Today the number of workouters is about 100 000 people in Russia!!!<br><br>


In fairness, it's worth noting that in the last few years, nothing has changed in the US, and street training has remained at the same level of popularity as it was. This is still the local history of a small group of people who gather in parks after work or on weekends.<br><br>

				
<b><h3>What do you need to know about Street Workout?</h3></b><br>
				
Finishing today's infopost, we would like you to remember the following key points for yourself:<br><br>


<b>1. 1. Unusual trainings came up in the USA.<br>
2. Street Workout (both the name itself and the movement, in the familiar form to us), were created in Russia.<br>
3. The training component of workout has nothing to do with gymnastics, both Soviet and modern.<br>
4. Anyone can train on horizontal and parallel bars, no matter what gender, age or level of physical training he/she has.<br>
5. Street Workout is not a sport or extreme.<br>
6. There are no trainers in Street Workout.<br>
7. Street Workout is about street.<br>
8. Street Workout is totally free.</b><br><br>

Now a little more about the last four points.<br><br>


<b>Street Workout is not a sport or extreme.</b> Why is this not a sport? Because the main attribute of any sport is the opposition of athletes to each other, comparison of achievements, competition. Workout traditionally denies the competitive component, because the main goal is not the victories, or achievements, or medals, but the health and development of a person.<br><br>


Why is it not extreme? Because extreme is aimed at getting the thrill, at the risk and adrenaline rush. The mission of workout is the improvement of a person without danger to his life and health. That's why this culture is built upon basic and natural exercises, but at the expense of the imagination it completes them, creating new variants and combinations.<br><br>


Unfortunately, many people have a wrong opinion about workout, based on numerous commercials on the Internet and television reports. In such videos, the word "workout" is used only in the title to attract attention, but in essence, gymnastic, acrobatic and any other spectacular / dangerous / beautiful tricks on horizontal and parallel bars, that have nothing to do with the workout culture, are shown.<br><br>


What's even more sad is that now there are guys who look at all these fashionable videos with tricks and numerous viewers and begin to treat workout respectively. They do not see training in it, nor a way of developing their body and spirit, all they see is the opportunity to surprise others or show themselves. Usually they train for a year or two, achieve certain successes and leave. That’s because they no longer have time to hang out near the horizontal bars for 5 hours a day (usually at the beginning of their way they study at a school or university), because other interests appear, or because they were injured in an attempt to learn a difficult element without proper preparation. We have seen this situation more than once and in many cities. What is remarkable, those, with whom we started in 2009, still train. Yes, they can rarely come to Sunday meetings, as they don’t have enough time because of family and work, but they continue work regularly in their hood. Workout is not just another hobby, it's a part of life for them. <br><br>

<i>The next point is devoted to the growing number of pseudo workout trainers coming from fitness or gymnastics, or just cunning guys who are trying to use a fashionable word to make money, although they have no idea what workout is. Such people and their behavior affects EXTREMELY the image of workout in the eyes of ordinary people.</i><br><br>


<b>There are no trainers in Street Workout.</b> From the very first days the whole culture was based on the principle <b>“each one teach one”</b>.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">MEMO:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">This is an African-American proverb that appeared in the United States during the time of the active slave trade, when black slaves had no access to education at all(including basic reading skills). And if one of the slaves could learn to read (or if his master taught him to read), then he considered it his duty to teach someone else. FOR FREE. </div></div><br><br>


In Street Workout culture there is no any trainers or teachers, all who comes to the ground are equal, but at the same time anyone is ready to share their experience and help others. Street Workout turns the sports grounds into places for meetings of like-minded people who come after work or study not only to exercise, but also to communicate, learn and share something with others. Only by this way it is possible to achieve the main goal of workout: so that as many people as possible learn about this culture and begin to train!<br><br>


In general, the meaning of the workout training component is that ORDINARY people work and PROFESSIONALS are not involved. This is the secret of its attractiveness, because if your colleague from work was able to achieve significant results, then it will motivate you much more, than a picture of a pompous fitnesist on the cover of a magazine, who devoted all his life, a lot of money and dumped his health for the sake of a beautiful picture.<br><br>

<b>Street Workout is about street.</b> This direction was born at street sports grounds. Unlike fitness clubs or gyms, the sport grounds are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and are absolutely free. You can come and work at any time, when it is convenient for you and do just as much as you want. In addition, when you are on the street - people see you! The best example is a personal example, and in this sense, you set an example for others. A positive example, which can push someone to go to the ground and start changing his life for the better.<br><br>


So, here it is. Well, there’s a lot of words today, but I just thought that you will be interested in learning about where everything started and in what direction you can move after you master the basics and finish the 100 Days Workout programm.</div>
