The skill to listen to your body is one of the important skills which you have to learn as soon as possible. You have successfully passed the major part of this road, but you have a lot of exciting trials ahead. And the higher the intensity and the complexity of the exercises are, the more important it is to listen to your signals which your body sends. Believe our experience, it is necessary to pay attention to these signals, because this makes your sessions more efficient and safe and helps you avoid many traumas which could be the reasons for beaks in workout sessions.<br><br>


You probably have had the situations when the sessions make you feel that today is not the best time to train, and it is better to stop training, or vice versa, you feel a drive and after several circuits you feel you are full of energy and ready to do more. These things happen, and they are very individual, by nature, therefore they can’t be included in the programs with the defined number of sets and reps. <br><br>


Let’s assume that you start training and feel that today is not a good day for training. May be, your knee/elbow aches, you are short of breath or not in a good mood. Of course, you may not pay attention to that and keep in mind that you must do the particular number of exercise, as a result you force yourself into training. Should we say that not paying attention to these signals can result in a trauma, sprain, dislocation or similar thing? Your body is trying to tell you that you shouldn’t train today, or your training program should be a bit different due to some intrinsic circumstances. But if you insist, then your body should adjust to you and involve the resources which mustn’t have been involved.<br><br>


Honestly speaking, you should tell these situations from usual laziness, but this is the skill to listen to your body. And here is a short list of signals to listen to when they occur:<br><br>


<b><h3>Pain (during or after am exercise)</h3></b><br>


<img src="../img/83-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


We have already written about the fact that you MUST NOT feel pain during or/and after the exercise. Being natural is one of the main characteristics of the bodyweight exercises. These exercises are known to us from our childhood, therefore appropriately done they shouldn’t bring any problems, while in a contrary case it means there is something wrong with their execution.<br><br>


The reasons for the pain can be different, so we will not discuss them here, but again we focus on how to FIND A SOURCE OF PROBLEM and to get rid of it rather than to fight against the pain (use pain-killing creams, gels, tapes, etc.). <br><br>


<b><h3>Unpleasant feelings in joints and muscles (dragging pain, flicks, crunches)</h3></b><br>


<img src="../img/83-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


If you didn't warm up properly, then your joints could flick or crunch during a session, but this could pass away in several reps/sets. Besides, this flick/crunch must not cause any discomfort or unpleasant feelings. Otherwise, the problem could become more serious, and every rep could worsen the situation.<br><br>


Here the advice is simple: if something is going wrong, or you feel that you don’t like it, then you’d better stop your training. For example, a flick/crunch could be the reason of inflammation of a ligament (just an example), if you give it rest, then with no other reasons in one-two days everything will be ok, and you may return to your sessions. But if you continue training, then every move could bring additional inflammation and prolong the recovery period. Very stubborn trainees could turn a minor trauma (micro tear of the ligaments, for example) into a very serious one (a ligament tear).<br><br>


And again, since you are planning to train for life (to be fit and all that stuff), a day or two days of rest won’t harm you. Bruce Lee said: “You must be shapeless, formless, like water.”<br><br>


<b><h3>General health (fatigue, sleepiness, impatience, sleep loss)</h3></b><br>


<img src="../img/83-3.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


Actually, we don’t always feel 100% perfect, joyful, happy and full of energy. There may be the moments when the session is scheduled, and we want to sleep (accumulated fatigue, sleep deprivations, stresses, so on), or just we were preparing for the exam or were preparing the reports before the session and didn’t have enough sleep. Geomagnetic storms, unexpected weather changes and other forces of nature could also be the reasons why you are not in the right mood for the session. Should we torture ourselves and train to the full?<br><br>


We believe there is no definite answer, and, as usual, this should be solved individually. Therefore, we could say that if you don’t feel good, then you’d better miss a session or do one light session.  Let me explain why – when you can’t concentrate on the right execution of an exercise, then the trauma risk is increased. If you just relax a bit or don’t put enough efforts, a problem can arise. Of course, nothing dangerous is likely to happen, but still this condition could easily result in a dislocation or strain, believe us.<br><br>


Our 100 Days Workout program was developed the way to give you a possibility to train every day (due to the adequate number of reps in every exercise in every circuit), but to make the program work, you should learn how to identify the right number of reps. Ideally, you should choose the exercises to be able to recover for the next session rather than to spend all your strength right away. If you do too little reps, then the program efficiency is low; if there are too many reps, then you are under risk of over-training. Here you should have experiments and analyze the results. The question “how many reps should be done” can be experimentally answered. <br><br>


The same is true for the technique of the exercise execution. We demonstrate general, optimal scenario based on biomechanics of the human body. Theoretically, it is for everyone, but as I have already mentioned above, we are all different, but the proposed scenario may not be suitable for some reasons. In this case, you should identify the BASIS of the exercises (it is based on physics from school curriculum, and we explain everything in detail) and try to replace it on your own. This replacement could be the basis of the exercises and suit your personal characteristics.<br><br>
