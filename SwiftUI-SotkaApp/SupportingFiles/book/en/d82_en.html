Bodyweight training is supposed to be one of the safest fitness types, although there is a risk of being injured, just like with any other type of physical activity.  You may not have enough warming-up exercises, or you may overestimate your strength, or you may refocus concentration and get distracted – all these things can be the reasons for this or that injury. So today we are going to speak about the most popular injuries among workouters. <br><br>


First of all, let me remind you about our previous info-post on this topic in BASIC block, where this issue was looked at on the whole. In fact, when we speak about injuries, here we should focus on  why they happen rather than on what injuries can occur, in other words, we should write about the existing risk factors for those who are doing workouts.  These factors can be divided into two big categories: internal and external factors. The first ones refer to the individual features of a workouter, which can create favorable conditions for an injury, while the second ones depend on the surroundings (training methods, sports field condition, etc.).  <br><br>


<h3>Internal factors</h3><br>


<b>Physical characteristics</b>. Height, weight, age, overweight if any, body conditioning level – these factors affect the risk of being injured. In this way workout is close to gymnastics and bodybuilding, and here people with a particular somatotype will be under higher risk than others. It would be harder for tall people to train than for the ones who are shorter (due to the difference in lever length). Older people would find it more difficult than the younger ones. Overweight people should gradually increase the training pace and don’t keep up with those who are not the first year on the bars. <br><br>


<b>Emotional condition</b>. This group of factors is primarily formed of different stresses you experience in your life. They negatively impact your psychological health and the right training mood and could become accelerating agents for injuries. When you go for a session, you must be focused on the process and leave all other thoughts behind the doors.<br><br>


<h3>External factors</h3><br>


<b>Exercise complexity</b>. The more complex the exercises are, the higher risk of injury is. In fact, traditional workout doesn’t include complex exercises, but it is highly influenced by similar disciplines (gymnastics and parkour, as a result, not being properly prepared, many trainees try complex gymnastic exercises and different types of jumps on the bars. It should be mentioned here that any jump presupposes some risk of being injured because at certain moments you are not supported by a bar.   <br><br>


<b>Attention and fatigue</b>. The lack of concentration is one of the main external factors for an injury. More often than not this happens during simple or routine exercises which you do hundred times.<br><br>


<b>Rehabilitation period</b>. Recurring injuries are likely to happen when returning to the sport field after full rehabilitation after an illness or injury.<br><br>


Even a full recovery doesn’t mean you can return to your standard loads, you should have a particular period for a gradual increase of exertion. When being injured you don’t have sessions, and your fitness level decreases, and this is quite natural, therefore you need time to return to the point before the injury.   <br><br>

<b>Competitions and pre-comp training</b>. We know that majority of people do workout for themselves, but there are also people who participate in different competitions on a regular basis (in general body conditioning or in bar freestyle). Here we can give you one useful advice – consider the competitions as tests for your progress rather than as a way to prove that you are a cool person or to please your ego. The results that you show at the competitions should show your level rather than be the purpose of your workout sessions. It can be compared with the marks at the university which show your achievements rather than become the purpose. Then the injury risk is likely to decrease!<br><br>


And now here is a short hit-list of the most popular traumas:<br><br>


1. Wrist<br>
2. Elbow<br>
3. Shoulder<br>
4. Lower back (back)<br>
5. Overtraining<br><br>


<h3>Wrist injuries</h3><br>


<img src="../img/82-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


If we look through all calisthenics exercises for the upper part of the body, then we see that wrists are extensively involved into them all! Are you doing chin-ups? Wrists are involved. Are you doing push-ups? It is wrists that are working. What about push-ups on bars? Wrist again. Doing arm balance? It’s wrist again. The wrists are under exertion all the time, therefore no wonder wrist injuries are at the top of our hit-list! During the sessions your wrists can experience huge loads, and if they are not appropriately prepared, or they are overloaded, then something bad is likely to happen.<br><br>


All problems with the wrists (and generally the problems with other parts of the body) can be divided into two categories: minor and major ones or temporary and chronic problems.  The first group refers to the overload of an unprepared wrist. For example, once learning how to do arm balance, many trainees complain of the pain in the wrists and hands. This is how the body signals about an excessive exertion. Don’t force the learning process, take rest, and the next day (or in a day) the pain disappears. Over time your body will get used to exertion, and you will not feel discomfort. That’s in theory. <br><br>


In real life you can be so strenuous to train and to learn everything at once, that your wrists can be overloaded, and you appear to find yourself at a no-return point (this is roughly the load level which requires a day for recovery). You may even not be lucky enough and strain your ligaments or have a similar minor but very unpleasant injury. In this case you should take time for recovery, probably several days or a week. These days should be spent with no exertion on wrists, or at least you should decrease the exertion to the minimal level (don’t do the exercises that cause pain) + wear special wrist support bands to limit the joint mobility. But wrist support bands solve a part of the problem and don’t eliminate the source of the problem, just like the case with the painkilling gels, therefore it’s better not to put exertion on the wrists for a time and give them time to recover.<br><br>


If in a week or two the pain doesn’t disappear, or you suspect that the injury is likely to be serious (for example, the pain occurs in everyday life), then you should definitely apply to a sport physician and find out more about what is happening.<br><br>


<h3>Elbow injuries</h3><br>


<img src="../img/82-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


Elbows come after wrists, because they are involved into nearly every exercise training the upper part of the body. When we speak about the elbows, then we must be sure to speak about the most popular problem – epicondylitis. Epicondyliltis is a widely spread disease with the pain in elbow joint (epicondyles of upper arm bone). The pain can be explained by the inflammation caused by a microtrauma of tendons in an elbow due to overexertion.   <br><br>


When can these overexertions occur during the workout sessions on bars and parallel bars? Most typically, this can happen when doing muscle-ups and single hand pull-ups. In the first case, novices are highly likely to be injured because their elbows face huge exertion they are not prepared for. If you have never tried doing muscle-ups, then you should definitely have experienced this unpleasant feeling in your elbows. The same is about single hand pull-ups. That goes without saying that this exercise should be prepared for, but still when you are to hold your body weight on one hand with your elbow joint only, it experiences a huge exertion. That’s why don’t forget to warm up and don’t try to force the progress, instead learn to feel your body and understand when it’s the time to do one more set, or when it’s time to stop. <br><br>


The problems with the elbows can also arise if you start doing some complex gymnastics elements too early, for example, front lever, back lever, or an iron cross on rings, where the elbow is under a huge exertion which causes joint hyperextension.  <br><br>


<h3>Shoulder injuries</h3><br>


<img src="../img/82-3.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


The structure of the shoulder makes it one of the most injury susceptible joint in our body. The workout doesn’t include a lot of exercises (this is not GIMBARR) with the risk of a shoulder injury, still I’ve decided to put shoulder injuries on the third place in today’s list. Fortunately, strains and inflammation of muscles, tendons and ligaments of the shoulder are the most widely spread injuries. They are not very serious, and once the time for recovery is taken, you can return to active sessions.<br><br>


A shoulder joint is one of the most mobile joints, that’s why this should be remembered when doing particular exercises which extensively involve it (for example, pull-ups and wide and very wide grip muscle-ups, typewriter pull-ups, others) – don’t try to do the exercises with the maximum amplitude. Start with the small amplitude and then gradually increase the amplitude while the shoulder is getting used to the exertion.<br><br>


<h3>Lower back injuries (and back injuries)</h3><br>


<img src="../img/82-4.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


Those trainees who start learning the gymnastics elements, including handstand, front/back levers, flag and horizon, with no special preparation are in the risk group to have a back injury. And this is the curse of workout, because in comparison with the gymnasts not many trainees follow verified methodologies and do the lead-ups. As a result, many people just want to repeat what they once saw in a video. Unfortunately, this approach results in injuries in 90% of cases, these injuries can be so serious that you mustn’t even think about the advanced level exercises. Here the back and the low back are the most susceptible because this exertion doesn’t fit the modern lifestyle. We don’t move much, sit a lot (not in the right posture), and the muscles of back and low back are not strong enough to do these exercises and to prevent an injury during the attempts to do the exercises. I think I will prepare one more info post concerning the situation that too many people want to start doing complex exercises, but at the moment I’ll not go any further in this area. <br><br>


I’d like to point out that when you are hanging on a bar, your spine is relaxed and is stretching due to gravity forces. At the same time when landing you create compressive exertion, and your relaxed and stretched spine shrinks unexpectedly. In simple words, this is not very healthy for it, therefore you should find the bar which you can come off rather than jump from, or just train soft landing to compensate the exertion to the maximum level.  <br><br>


Back injuries are really serious matter and usually they last for the life. That’s why think twice before you try!<br><br>


<h3>Overtraining</h3><br>


<img src="../img/82-5.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


To put it simply, overtraining is the body condition caused by fatigue arisen from the sessions. Overtraining is likely to result in the most unpleasant consequences, including result regression, apathy to the session, reduced general condition, immunity weakness, increased fatigue and irritation, etc. Overtraining mainly occurs due to an undeveloped skill to plan your exertion and to compile your training schedule, that’s why this situation is more typical for the novices. Many trainees who have just started their training want to get the results as much as possible, and they believe they should train as much as possible. In fact, it is not about the quantity, but about quality, being smart, which means that you should learn to understand how the body functions and intermingle sessions with the periods of rest to recover.<br><br>


<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>


We have already mentioned at the beginning of today’s post that workout is one of the safest types of physical activities, but still it is injury susceptible. However, if you control external and internal factors and be aware of the most popular injuries (forewarned is forearmed!), then you can minimize the risk. Have efficient and safe sessions!
