There are many different opinions about drinking during the training, as it depends on a large number of parameters: for example on the intensity of the training and its duration, the level of fitness and general mood, the weather, etc. It is worth noticing that the more you are prepared for the load (adapted to it), the easier you take it and the less energy you spend. It means you'll want to drink less.<br><br>

<h3>How much water should one drink?</h3><br>


The most common recommendation: to drink about 1.5-2 liters of water a day. In this case, tea, coffee, juices and lemonades are not considered as water! However, this recommendation is very general, so you shouldn't take it too seriously. All people are different, they have different lifestyles and habits, they live in different conditions, and therefore, their water consumption will be different. In general, there can be the following recommendation: if you want to drink - then drink.<br><br>


As for the diuretic properties of certain types of fluids, which are mentioned above, then here everything is individually again and connected with the hormonal system of the body. We will talk in details about hormones in the ADVANCED BLOCK.<br><br>

<h3>Why is it so important to drink water during the training?</h3><br>


While training, we sweat profusely - in this way our body reacts to the temperature rise, which is the result of the active muscle work. Depending on the intensity of training and external conditions, the body can lose from 0.5 to 1.5-2 liters of water.<br><br>


By the way, many people confuse this natural process with losing weight. But this is just an illusion, the same as the hope to lose weight, exhausting oneself with a long staying (and sweating) in the sauna. Unfortunately, there is no way to lose weight by doing it. This is only a temporary dehydration of the body. The number of fat cells does not decrease by active sweating (dehydration) , no matter how much you torture yourself.<br><br>


On the contrary, the loss of a large amount of water leads to an increase in the blood viscosity in the body, which means that it becomes more difficult for the heart to pump it. Apart from the heart (increase in blood pressure), the load goes to other organs, for example, the kidneys (decrease in the quality of renal filtration and removing the decay products from the body).<br><br>


The amount of water drunk during the training should roughly correspond to the amount of liquid evaporated by the body. But since it is almost impossible to calculate, I recommend you to focus on your own feeling of thirst.<br><br>



It should be borne in mind that when breathing through the mouth, thirst will be felt stronger than the actual needs of the body for the water, and intense weight training dulls the thirst.<br><br>


On training days, especially during the hot season, you need to drink even more, because with intensive physical activity the body loses not only water, but also electrolytes. These substances exist in the blood in the form of salts, acids and alkalis, which, among other things, carry molecules of water along the blood vessels to all the tissues of the body. The decreasing of their number can lead to serious disruption in the work of many organs.<br><br>


<h3>How should we drink during the work out?</h3><br>

We've discussed the question of the necessity of the water during the training, now we are to find out how we should drink. The general advice that can be given on this issue is be adequate in drinking and do not drink to such a condition that the water in the stomach interferes your training, creating a feeling of heaviness. In addition, an excessive amount of water can really increase the impact on the heart. Therefore, drink in small portions, quenching thirst and freshening up.<br><br>
