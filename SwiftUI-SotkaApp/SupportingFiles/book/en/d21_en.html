 It is said that you have to repeat an action for 21 days straight in order to develop a habit. Believe me or not, but fitness, training, clean eating and healthy lifestyle are slowly becoming a part of your everyday life!<br><br>


WorkOut is something much more than just working out with bodyweight exercises on street playgrounds. It's a lifestyle, and we want to make you familiar with it and it's philosophy. This is why we will use last day of each training week covering different interesting topics. Today we will talk about the rule of 10 000 hours!</b>!<br><br>


According to the studies of <b>Anders Erickson</b> (sociologist) it take one about <b>10 000 hours</b> of practice to master the skill to the world class level. While his studies were conducted on musicians (at first on violinists, then on pianists), but he makes a conclusion that the very same rule works, actually, in any other human area of activity. There is no difference, either we talk about music (most popular example is Beatles) or intellectual games (Fisher) or business (Bill Gates). 10 000 hours of practice and success, almost, guaranteed.<br><br>


Despite the fact that we can doubt this rule (especially the exact number of 10 000 hours), but our common sense says that there is something right in it. The more time you spend on something, the better you become (especially if you understand what you are doing and not simply repeating after someone). And WorkOut is not an exclusion from this rule.<br><br>


It takes a certain amount of time to learn from the scratch how to perform even basic exercises, such as pull-ups, push-ups and squats. This is why our program is build around circuit training approach and we ask you to focus your efforts on learning right technique. You have to learn the gammas before you could start playing music, rythms, dynamics, and so on.<br><br>


While there is a certain barrier in overall quantity which you have to pass, it is also important to remember that our body has a limit of minimum and maximum number of training volume per day. If you train too little, the body doesn't get enought information. If you train too much, the body would be overtrained and too tired to concentrate on training. We have designed 100KA program according to this principle, so you could train everyday and not get overtrained. By the way, a small note to those who think that the starting 5-10-10-10 routine is not giving enough training load. Whose who will make it to the end of the program will do around 3500 pull-ups, 7500 squats and 6500 push-ups. Pretty tought, right? And pretty enough to master the right technique of this basic moves, ofcause, if you follow all our advices and watched your quality carefully!<br><br>


Sadly, but too many people are rushing when it comes to training, and WorkOut and calisthenics is no exclusion. People try to learn elements and tricks before they have build the basics. And the only result they get from that is injuries. So, we suggest you not to rush. You are going to spend the rest of your life training and selfperfecting yourself, so a couple of months or even a couple of years don't matter in this case, if you really like what you are doing.<br><br>


Probably, from the point of view of mastering the technique of the basic moves, it would be more effective to spend all 100 days doing the very same circles. But we also understand that this is not only physical training, but mental training as well. And bringing differencies to training routines leads to the decrease of mental load and makes training sessions more fun and interesting (especially for beginners). This is why we will continue to emphasize the value of clean technique, but we will bring some modifications to the programm later, making it more difficult and more interesting.
