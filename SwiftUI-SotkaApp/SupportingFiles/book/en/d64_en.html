The second week of <b>ADVANCED</b> block has gone so it is right time to sum up the information we have learned. We have learned new exercise technique, got some information on glycemic index, found out that sport nutrition doesn't worth it, and alcohol doesn't worth it at all, and also learned about immune system and muscle convulsions.<br><br>


New week is a new beginning, so let's go and learn one more advanced technique!<br><br>


<b><h3>Advanced techiniques are the ways to bring complexity and variety into our programme. If the standard technique is enough for you at the moment just keep it that way for a time being.</h3></b><br><br>


You are free to add advanced techniques, such as movement in space, into your workout. If the your physical level is enough then you can use advanced techniques. If you find them too difficult or if you can't get the required number of reps, then don't include them now and just keep in mind these options for your futher training. Also you can intensify a single exercise, for example, only pull-ups or squats.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">Reminder!</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body"><b>1.</b> Keep rest periods between sets in each exercise WITHIN 60 seconds. That is, do the first pull-up set, have a minute rest, do the second pull-up set etc. At the same time a rest period shall not be less than 30 seconds. The rest period between exercises is SIMILAR.<br><br>


<b>2.</b> The number of sets in each exercise is 6, but since the work load has changed, we would recommend that you return to the starting number of reps in each set, and then increase it, if you find that too easy. Within the ADVANCED block it is very important to learn to assess your strengths.<br><br>


<b>3.</b> If doing an exercise or a set you can't perform the required number of repetitions, this set is considered to be the last for this exercise. THE MAIN THING is DO NOT WORRY IF IT HAPPENED!<br><br>


This limit is introduced mostly for you to be able to recover in 24 hours between training sessions to keep training every day. So if you fail to choose the right number of reps, (it is likely in the beginning), the limit will protect you from overtraining. At least that's what we expect.<br><br>


<b>4.</b> If you realize at some point that the ADVANCED block work load becomes excessive, you can always get back to your regular training and standard techniques for a few days. You can alternate the circuits and workouts based on doing sets, as well as standard and advanced techniques throughout the week. Anyway, you can have some creative input here as we all are different, and we still have too few statistics on the ADVANCED block to give you universal recommendations!</div></div><br><br>


<h3>TECHNIQUE: MOVEMENT IN SPACE</h3><br>

Today we will learn a technique which will add movement in space to your regular repetitions. The idea is to make a regular rep then to make a move either to the left or to the right (or forward/backward) and do the next rep.<br><br>
 
 
 Let's look on pull-ups, for example. You hang on a bar, make a pull-up, then move to the side and do another one. It is easier to understand via videos:<br><br>

The same technique applies to push-ups, squats and lunges:<br><br>

Good luck!
