When we were creating Street Workout one the cornerstones was the idea that everyone is equal on the training spot. It does not matter how long you have been training, or if you are worse or better, or what you know and are able to, the only thing that is important that you have come to train. The only one you are competing again is yourself and if you are getting better day by day, week by week, month by month, then you have chosen the right way. Those were the days, where we came for training and we trained, when Street Workout was Street Workout and not gymnastics mixed with breakdance, when there was an atmosphere of friendliness and mutual support.<br><br>


But somewhere in the way we have los control since thousands of people started joining Street Workout movement throughout the whole country. They had a different point of view on the movement, bringing their own ideas and starting to change the game. Unavoidably it leaded to total change of ideas behind workout. To tell you the truth, I am sick of being asked “how long have you trained?”, “what elements do you do?”, “show me this or show me that”. When people find out that I mostly do basic exercises and do not care of gymnastics, they are surprised: “you’ve trained so long and you know nothing!” and most of the time these questions come from either total beginners or those who do not train at all. The higher your level the more you understand that you do it for yourself and not for street circus.<br><br>


 It happens mostly because the modern base of Street Workout consists of teenagers, they are striving to impress right now on the spot and hardly care about working for the future. This did not exist when we first started it but now this is common place. I see guys who think that they are cooler than others because they know tricks that others do not and they are not willing to share their knowledge with these others. I think it is nonsense.<br><br>


 I will not be talking about that lifestyle of local “leaders” which is not that healthy and they could be hardly called role models. I think it is the price for Street Workout being so popular and this trend attracts all the kinds of people including those who prefer to play dirty.<br><br>


Well, let’s leave current state of workout alone with the hope that it will mature some time in the future and get rid of all the dirt. Actually all street sports have the same common issues. The first is that they are popular among schoolers and that they discuss sports over the Internet. The Internet is not the ideal place in terms of mutual respect and decency of language since your opponent in most cases is too far from you and it provokes to lower your standards of communication. It is a psychological problem. It looks like everyone is bullying everyone and everyone is being bullied by bodybuilders. It is kind of useless to wage flame wars with people on the Interne just stop doing it and go to sleep.<br><br>


The whole point of today’s post is: respect others and then they will respect you.
