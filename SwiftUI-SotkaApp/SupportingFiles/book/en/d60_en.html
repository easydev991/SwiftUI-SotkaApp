Alcohol impact on the body and on the session efficiency is clear, but still needs to be discussed in our educational program.<br><br>


<b> Alcohol (ethyl alcohol)</b> – does not contain protein, carbohydrates, fats, but its caloric value is 7 calories/g. In its properties it is closer to carbohydrates, but in comparison with them it can’t convert into glycogen and be stored into the muscles for further use.<br><br>


Let’s put it straight: we are not going to speak about social issues and alcohol abuse. You can easily find the information about the harm done by the alcohol. We will focus on alcohol impact on a body of a person who has regular and active training sessions.<br><br>


<b><h3>Alcohol impact on a body</h3></b><br>


Let’s look through the effects the alcohol has on the body when alcohol is consumed:<br><br>


<b>1. Digestive system.</b> Alcohol irritates mucous membrane of the esophagus and stomach, leads to esophagitis and gastritis, respectively. In the stomach, alcohol can impact the functioning of the valve which regulates the entry of the food into small intestine. The valve can be completely blocked. What is more, alcohol can negatively affect pancreatic gland, being the one of three widely spread reasons for pancreatitis.<br><br>


<b>2. Liver.</b> Having been absorbed in the digestive system, alcohol gets into liver where it continues its destructive impact on the body. Long-term alcohol consumption can result in cirrhosis, thus the liver becomes deprived of its functions in blood purification from toxins (including body’s toxins arising from the life processes).<br><br>


<b>3. Brain.</b> Once in the brain, alcohol breaches sleeping processes. On the one hand, alcohol causes sleepiness, while, on the other hand, it worsens the sleeping quality and results in long-term under-recovery which can be similar to the lack of sleep. Memory blackouts, when you can’t remember what you do while drinking, mean that alcohol concentration in blood has seriously damaged the brain functions. Gradually, these situations of chronic alcohol intoxication can lead to Wernicke disease – the body is unable to consume B1 vitamin, which significantly violates the brain cortex functioning.<br><br>


<b>4. Cardio-vascular system.</b> Alcohol reduces the production of the blood formed elements (erythrocytes, leucocytes, thrombocytes), which, in its turn, leads to anemia, weakens immunity, reduces blood clotting ability, increases the risk of internal bleeding. Long-term alcohol consumption results in hypercardia, which worsens heart blood circulation (and increases the risk of heart attack). The episodes of periodic alcohol intoxication (drinking to celebrate the events is widely spread) causes irregular heart rate.<br><br>


What is more, alcohol slows down the anabolic processes in the body since the digestive system absorbs less nutritious substances. The blood experiences the deficit in amino acids which are so necessary for the muscles. Together with the insufficient amount of protein, the glycogen amount is reduced, which negatively affects your agility, strength and speed.<br><br>


How your body consumes the alcohol is the reason of the effects. Alcohol gets into the blood via intestine. The blood transfers alcohol into liver where the first processing stage takes place. Enzyme called dehydrogenases converts alcohol into acetic aldehyde which is highly toxic. Other enzymes convert acetic aldehyde into acetic acid and then into carbon dioxide, water and energy. It is believed that with alcohol you force your body into postponing the process of fat oxidation. The same process occurs when you consume a huge amount of fast-acting carbohydrates (cakes, sweets, etc.). As a result, together with a huge amount of food and additional energy from the alcohol, a slow metabolism of fats helps the body to store fats better.<br><br>


Due to alcohol consumption, the body loses a huge amount of water. Dehydrated muscles lose their elasticity, slow down the transfer of useful and harmful substances. And here the workouts can only harm, and muscle mass can reduce. Sport organizations warn against alcohol consumption before the sessions or during them due to its negative impact on metabolism under the load, on temperature regulation, coordination and concentration of attention. A direct impact of alcohol on athletic activities can be observed for several hours after the intoxication is over.<br><br>


<b><h3>Moderate consumption</h3></b><br>

Sometimes you can read the information that the doctors recommend drinking in small dosage, they say it is not harmful. In fact, if you refer to the original sources, the recommendations are a bit different. The doctors say that if you already consume the alcohol, then it’s better to consume it in small dosage for your health. In no way do they persuade you into drinking to improve your health.<br><br>


According to the World Health Organization report, a moderate consumption is a daily drinking of no more than 20 g of ethanol for men and 10 g of ethanol for women with its equivalent calculation into ethanol concentration in a drink. If the dosage is 1.5 times increased, the risk of typical diseases increases 1.5 times and more exponentially. <br><br>

At the same time, regular consumption in small dosage improves inflammatory markers, blood lipid profiles, insulin responsiveness of the tissues.  Regular moderate consumption (8 – 16 g of ethanol per day) improves high density cholesterol indicators, heart rate variability, vascular endothelium functions, blood clotting ability, which lowers the risks of heart attacks and strokes. It seems that it is cool, isn’t it? It doesn’t work that way. In the long-term, small alcohol dosages have a positive impact on the cardio-vascular system in a number of indicators, although right after the intake (up to 24 hours) the risks of heart attacks and strokes are higher than in case of non-drinking people. Alcohol consumption causes metastasis in the liver and slows the recovery in case of cancer.
