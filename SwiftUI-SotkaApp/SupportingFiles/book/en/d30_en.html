Does aging affect training? I don't know why a lot of people are quite worried about the numbers which show their age, but since this topic is interesting for the participants of our program, then are dedicating today's infopost to it!<br><br>


It is said that a man is as old as he feels, as he feels himself old. And that's true. But not 100%. Our health, our beauty, our abilities - this all depends much more on our lifestyle, on how we spend our time during the day, on our eating habits, on our training regimen and several other factors. In any case, much more than on the numbers showing our age. If you want to attach any real sense to these numbers, then I suggest you should use them as a counter for the number of turnovers you have made across the Sun during your life.<br><br>


We don't say that nothing changes while you are aging, but I want you to understan one simple thing: there is no universal law that all people should be one way at 30 years old and another way at 35 years old. Even if we take people of the same age from the same city we would find an amusing diversity among them.<br><br>


But somewhere about 30 certain changes begin to develop on one's body, which become stronger year by year. For example an average person after 30 years begin to lose around 250 grams of dry muscle mass per year. And this is just one moment. And the older you get the more of such moments appear. This is called a nature aging process, which is genetically given. The morning sun never lasts a day.<br><br>


But this doesn't mean that nothing can be done about it. <b>"Health is wealth and movement is medicine!"</b> - these words were not just a moto for WorkOut movement, but they are also 100% truth! Health is the most important thing in your life and if you want to save it - you need to move, you need to train!<br><br>


<b>The stronger your body is, the easier it will overcome the aging process. It is easier to recover from any malaise, injury or desease if you are constantly moving around!</b><br><br>


Did you notice that a lot of people, as they become older, tend to move less and slower? It looks like they are preparing themselves that one day they will just stop at all! Don't be like that! Keep moving no matter what age you are and you will feel yourself healthier, stronger and happier! No matter what your age is, you are young enough to start!
