Second week of our program has passed and we have successfully reviewed all the questions regarding nutrition and proper dieting. Now you know what is caloric balance, what your food consists of, what's the difference between protein, carbohydrates and fat, and discovered why there is huge difference between same portions of cereal and chocolate bar. And we also made through the practical lesson of creating your very own dieting plan.<br><br>


Futher in BASIC block you will recieve 36 more useful infoposts, and first thing we want to talk about is proper breathing during exercise. Ofcause, we have already mentioned this topic when we discussed <b>pull-ups</b>, <b>push-ups</b> and <b>squats</b>, but there is something more we have to tell you. That's why we dedicate a solo infopost for this topic. We have even made a video for better understanding!<br><br>


<h3>Proper breathing</h3><br>

Еveryone knows that you have to breathe properly during a workout. Unfortunately, a lot of people, and especially beginners, instantly forget about it during their training and start to breathe randomly or even hold their breath during the exercise stress (and it’s not good). At the same time, just proper breathing, which is synchronized with the exercise process, can let you significantly increase efficiency and improve the results of your training. <br><br>

				
Here are the common rules of breathing during the exercises:<br><br>


<b>1.</b> take a breath before the start of an exercise (and each repetition during it);<br>
<b>2.</b> exhale during positive phase of an exercise;<br>
<b>3.</b> inhale during negative phase of an exercise;
<br><br>


Example: Pull-ups. Come to a bar and put your hands on it. Take a breath. Start to contract your muscles (by pulling your body up) and at the same time start to exhale. Ideally, at the top point all air should be exhaled. Then start to straighten your hands and inhale the air, while lowering your body down. At the bottom point inhale the volume of air needed.<br><br>


It’s hard to say something about the depth of breathing, but it should be comfortable and, obviously, it depends on tempo of execution (there will be an infopost on this issue too). I mean, the faster the tempo, the less volume of air you can breathe in/breathe out (just to have time to do an exercise) and vice-versa.<br><br>


By the way, a few words about recommendation on breathing through the nose. There are 2 main reasons for that:<br><br>

<b>1.</b> This method allows you to heat inhaled air, so lowering the risk of overcooling – and at the same time the warm air is kept inside (what is important for the cold time of year).<br>
<b>2</b>  Also nasal mucosa and tiny hairs filters the air to sieve out the dust and microbes;<br><br>


At the same time, if you’re exhaling with your mouth, it can help you to let the air out faster.<br><br>


Also, it should be noted that proper breathing depends on type of an exercise that you do.<br><br>


<b>Strength exercises</b>, which we do in our 100-day workout program It’s recommended to make an exhale at the time of the maximum muscular effort and inhale, while the muscle effort is the least. <br><br>

Always remember that the breath holding is prohibited. The thing is during an inhale the intra-abdominal and arterial pressure increases as well as physical load on the cardio-vascular system. Obviously, an additional load from a performing exercise would be unnecessary. Moreover, it’s easier to concentrate an effort during an exhalation. Therefore, if you start to notice that you’re holding your breath, this means that the current exercise is too difficult for you and you have to decrease exercise intensity.<br><br>

<b>Stretching exercises</b>, which we do in the last day of each training week. This group contains all different kinds of bending exercises, rotations, swings, hands and legs circling movements, basically all exercises that are usually included into warming-up. It also includes the exercises for flexibility development. Relaxation (stretching) of muscles should be done during an exhalation, while returning to start position should be done during inhalation respectively.<br><br>

<b>Cyclic exercises.</b> Walking, running, bicycling, swimming etc. All these exercises can be classified as aerobic. In such exercises it’s very important to catch a rhythm of breathe, which would correspond to the movements and try to follow it. Irregular, with pauses, or on the contrary, hurried breathing can break the rhythm of running, cause the problems with coordination and doesn’t provide the proper lung ventilation.<br><br>
