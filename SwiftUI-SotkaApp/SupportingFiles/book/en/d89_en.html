When our <b>SOTKA</b> programm will be over, you will have to move futher on your own way. But we would like you to be prepared for this moment and have enough knowledge and skills. As it is widely said, the main task of the higher education institution is not to teach us things, but is to teach us how to learn things. We believe it to be the right idea, because it is impossible to teach everything and to give you the answers to all questions. But if you teach a person how to find the answers, then this person will have no problems at all. When the program is over, you will face a dilemma: which programs to follow, which training schemes to choose, how to compile the programs on one’s own, and so on. This is exactly what we are going to talk about here!<br><br>


 The interviews with the legendary Street Workout athletes can give you an impression that they do not stick to any programs and get excellent results. This is true, but it only works at the really advanced level. Just to give you an analogy: imagine a Kung Fu master and a beginner. The master knows the essence of King Fu and can train as he/she wishes, while his/her follower is at the very beginning of the path and therefore should follow simple and comprehendible schemes not to forget anything, not to miss anything, to do everything and to achieve the result.  These are the Kung Fu laws. The same is true about workout. Unless you achieve the heights (believe me, you understand when it happens), you need a program.<br><br>


There are several key rules to prepare training programs which you should follow to make them efficient. They are as follows:<br><br>


<b>Firstly</b>, your program should match you goals. It means that at the beginning you identify your goals and then find the ways to achieve them. Workouts to gain muscle mass, workouts to increase the number of repetitions, workouts to do new difficult exercise/element – these are different types of workout sessions, and to achieve the result, your program should be prepared accordingly.<br><br>


So, here are some good examples of goals: gain Х kilos of muscles, loose Х kilos, train to pull up 25 times, run 100 meters in 14 seconds in 3 months, and so on. And here are bad examples of goals: to get fit, to train the muscles, to gain mass, to become more agile. Your goals should ALWAYS be measured in quantity. You can control only the things that can be measured. <br><br>


<b>Secondly</b>, your program should match your training level and individual features. I have already told you about it several times, that it is useless to take ready programs from the Internet and follow them. You should study different exercises, different workout sessions’ schemes and protocols, learn more about yourself, know your strong sides and weaknesses. After that the only thing to do is to develop a program with this knowledge.<br><br>


<b>Thirdly</b>, your workout session should start with complex and difficult exercises. At the beginning (surely after warming-up) you have enough strength and concentration to do these exercises. Therefore, the more complex the exercise is, or the more load there is, or the more repetitions it requires, the earlier it should be done in a session. The press exercises can be done at the end of the session, like after-training.<br><br>


<b>Forthly</b>, your program should include the exercises to train ALL main muscle groups. Even those groups that you you don't like to train! Very often we don’t like to do the exercises that load our weak muscles, but we like the exercises which show that we are strong. This approach destroys the balance and increases the risk of becoming traumatized. Therefore, the programs should be based on logics and analysis rather than on emotional attitude towards the exercises.<br><br>


This principle is the main criterion to the exercise selection in our <b>100 Days Workout</b> program: pull-ups for the muscles responsible for bending arms and back, push-ups for the muscles responsible for arms and chest extensors, squats for the legs. This is the BASICS.<br><br>


<b>Fifyhly</b>, your training program should fit your daily routine and rhythm of life. It is useless to make up the plans which you are unlikely to follow, but it is better to consider your possibilities in terms of free time for workout sessions and available implements. Use your imagination and create the exercises which can help you to train your body in available conditions. This is a good warm-up activity for the brain too.<br><br>


<b>Sixthly</b>, your program should have a training load progression over time. Let us remind you that stress is the only factor that can change your body. Stress occurs when the body faces something it is not ready for. If you follow the same program all the time, your body gets used to it, and the response will fall. To avoid it, you should increase the load from time to time (there are hundreds of possible variables: chosen exercises, performance time, relaxation time, combination of the exercises, etc.).<br><br>


<b>DO NOT TRY to create a PERFECT programm</b> (because there are none) and don’t be afraid to make mistakes in planning time. This is quite normal. In this case the process of creating a training program and changes introduced into it, when some results are achieved, rather than the scheme on the paper are important. Even the best program will not work forever, because our body has a very good ability to adapt to the load, therefore, some changes should be introduced into the program from time to time, or the whole program should be redone. Along with that, you should try to increase the load over time. Here we are talking not only about the increase in the number of repetitions in a set, because the load can be increased with more complex exercises, less relaxation time, more loading time, exercise combinations, etc. The program of sessions is not a doctrine, but rather a way to achieve the goal, therefore, I see what works and then adjust it accordingly.<br><br>


Here is a good tool for you to evaluate the quality of your training program. It is called <b>Anton Kuchumov Matrix</b>.<br><br>
