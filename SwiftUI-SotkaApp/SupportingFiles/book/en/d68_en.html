What is running? Running is a readily available exercise for building up endurance. Everyone can run, it requires minimal equipment, that is interchangeable with the workout equipment, except for the proper footwear. You can run almost anywhere. Running can be an excellent addition to bars and parallel bars, enhancing them, not disrupting.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">IMPORTANT!!!</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">The information in the infoposts this week is given for illustrative purposes and for extending your outlook (if you do have an educational program). We recommend using it AFTER the program.</div></div><br><br>


<b><h3>The benefits of running</h3></b><br>

1. running strengthens not only the muscles directly involved in the process, but also our main muscle – the cardiac muscle. The heart becomes stronger, improving the blood circulation and oxygen supply to the vital systems of the body;<br>
2. Aside from the heart, running has a positive impact on the immune system and the functioning of the central nervous system;<br>
3. As nearly all muscles are involved in running, the joints are also strengthened – they are inseparable after all;<br>
4. running keeps you in good shape, helps fight breathlessness, nasal cold and hypertonia;<br>
5. Regular running outdoors contributes to the body conditioning;<br>
6. running is a good choice if you are planning to lose weight – it is one of the most energy-consuming activities;<br>
7. running can help overcome depression, because it aids in releasing endorphin, the hormone of happiness, and stress relief.<br><br>


<b><h3>running and muscles</h3></b><br>


Many muscles are trained while running, the main are legs and gluteus muscles:<br><br>


<div class="text post-body-text"><img src="../img/68-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"></a><br><br>


1. Gluteus muscles help to support the body in vertical position properly. The shape and width of our buttocks depend on them.<br>
2. Hip muscles are bundled into four groups on the back side of the hip. They are responsible for knee flexion.<br>
3. Quadriceps – unlike the previous types, these are located on the front side of the hip and are responsible for knee extension. They play an important part in moving knee and hip joints during running.<br>
4. Iliac muscles also perform the knee flexing function. Sometimes after intense training they may cause pain in the hip, signaling that you should stop training;<br>
5. Calves are the muscles located in the shin. They help raise the body during running and stabilise it.<br><br>


At the same time, running loads other muscles (see below), although to a lesser extent:<br><br>


<div class="text post-body-text"><img src="../img/68-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img"></a><br><br>


1. SCM (sternocleidomastoid) muscle.<br>
2. Serratus muscles.<br>
3. Deltoid muscle (front and middle).<br>
4. Biceps of the arms.<br>
6. Forearm muscles (wrist and finger extensors).<br>
7. Brachial muscle.<br>
8. Greater pectoral muscle.<br>
9. Serratus anterior.<br>
10. Intercostal muscles.<br>
11. Abdominal muscle.<br>
12. Abdominal external oblique muscle.<br><br>


<div class="text post-body-text"><img src="../img/68-3.jpg" class="bbcode_img"></a><br><br>


1. Deltoid muscle (back).<br>
2. Triceps of the arm.<br>
3. Forearm muscles (wrist and finger flexors).<br>
4. Trapezius.<br>
5. Latissimus dorsi.<br>
6. Long muscles of the back.<br><br>


<b><h3>Distance running</h3></b><br>


running is divided into several types, according to the distance:<br><br>


<b>1. Long distance.</b> Range from 5 km to the marathon (42.195 km) and even more. The main thing is to estimate your own abilities just to get to the finish. Long-distance running is particularly popular among amateurs. If you have never run regularly before, then you should start from long distances – the running technique is the most economical.<br><br>

<b>2. Middle distance.</b> Range from 800 to 3000 m. Here you need to develop both speed and endurance. It is the most demanding to the running technique and the locomotor system. Mid-distance running technique requires special training and exercises.<br><br>

<b>3. Short distance.</b> Maximum speed. Range from 60 to 400 m. Highly demanding to the running technique and the athlete’s physical condition.<br><br>

Regardless of the distance you are going to run, it is best to start mastering the technique from long distances. The speed is relatively low, but the running pattern is applicable to all types of running.<br><br>


<b><h3>How to start running</h3></b><br>


Before you do your first run, you need to make sure that you have a proper footwear. At present, there is an abundance of sport shoes brands on the market, but not all of them are fit for running. First of all, sneakers have a tread with damping properties. Gym sport shoes do not have these properties, sport shoes for indoor sports have a tread specifically designed for indoors and do not fit the outdoor activities. The regular footwear resembling sneakers have no running properties at all.  <br><br>


But even running sneakers differ a lot. They are produced for people of different weight (heavier people need more dampening material and vice versa), for different distances (the shorter the distance, the lighter the tread and less dampening material), for different surfaces (spiked shoes for stadium tracks, for solid surfaces like asphalt, concrete, slabs or for rough ground; there are even shoes with built-in spikes for running on ice). Every big brand has a special tool on their website to choose the necessary sport shoes – it is worth using. However you should make you final choice after trying the sneakers on at the shop.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">Sidenote</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">If you have 10 or more kg extra weight, then we recommend lowering it to 10 kg or less. Every extra kilogram means extra loads on your joints, muscles, cords and ligaments.</div></div><br><br>


All you need is to go out and start running.


<b><h3>Running tips for beginners</h3></b><br>


A heart-rate monitor is a great asset – it will allow you to control your loads during the training. Initially, we advise to run at no more than 80% of your maximum heart rate. If you don’t know that number, you can take 150 bpm or lower as a reference. That does not mean that you need to run at 150 bpm, it should be your maximum rate, even if you run very slowly!<br><br>


Try to run at a relaxed and calm tempo, avoiding any vertical fluctuations, pushing forward off the ground, not up. Do not extend your foot too far and don’t land on the heel – it will slow you down and generate extra load on you knee joint. The rule of proper technique: the foot must touch the surface under your centre of gravity.<br><br>


You must look ahead and see the surface 10-20 metres in front of you. Do not strain your shoulders – arms and shoulders must be as relaxed as possible. The arms must move forward and backward in a good swing. Do not press the elbows to your body and don’t shake them sideways. The elbows must make a 90-degree angle; the fists must be slightly clenched. You should keep your body straight up and slightly leant forward.<br><br>


Step frequency is called <b>cadence</b>. The cadence of regular walking is 100-120 steps/min, in running you should keep in mind 180±10 steps/min as a reference. If you make more or fewer steps, then you can ask more experiences runners for advice.<br><br>


You should also clearly evaluate your abilities and not set any over-the-top goals. First try to run a few kilometres or for 10-15 minutes. If you don’t feel bad immediately after the run or the next day, then you can gradually increase the distance. If the distance was too long, you lose your breath, it is very hard to run, you have pain in your legs or anywhere else, you feel dizzy, your heart rate exceeds 150 bpm (or 80% of your maximum heart rate), if your muscles ache after the run or the next day, then you should split the distance into fractions of running and walking and switch them like this: 1-2 minutes running, 1-2 minutes walking and so on, keeping track of your well-being and increasing the periods of running. <br><br>


Run every other day first, i.e. 3 times a week. Do it until you can run 30 minutes three times a week without any problems. <br><br>


A simple but essential rule: do not add more than 10% to your distance per week!<br><br>


You can easily combine 2-4-kilometre runs with our 100 Days Workout programm. 5 and more kilometres will fatigue you. You can do running before or after you take up 100-day training – the choice is yours. Scholars are still debating when it is better to run - before or after the weight routine, so it is up to you. running before training can count as a proper warm-up.<br><br>


After running you should stretch the main groups of leg muscles: quadriceps, back hip and calves. If you combine running and weight routines, then you should stretch after finishing all the exercises.<br><br>


Aside from regular watch or heart-beat monitors, there are numerous apps for smartphones allowing you to track your running, recording time, speed and even your heart beat if you have an extra sensor. All that makes it much easier to keep your running logbook. Many apps include off-the-shelf training routines for beginners.<br><br>


Do not be afraid of running, reject the stereotypes that running is a drudgery that drains both time and stamina. The preferable type of running is everyone’s individual choice. Remember that at some point of your physical fitness you must evaluate your abilities properly. You should achieve results by doing regular exercises, not by taking excess loads. You will succeed if you remember the simple ‘CCG’ rule – commensuration, continuity, graduality.
