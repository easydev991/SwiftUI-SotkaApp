This week was full of talks on how to create training programs by yourself. All these talks were more of theoretical than practical nature. But today we want to teach you some practical skills!<br><br>


Here is a step-by-step instruction:<br><br>


<h3>Step №1: Identify the GOAL</h3><br>


All training goals could be divided into either overall or specific body conditioning. This is a global goal. A specific goal can be expressed in the number of exercise repetitions, the number of sets, training time, etc. For the beginners it is quite reasonable to focus on overall conditioning, while for more advanced trainees overall conditioning is also a must, and specific conditioning can be included with your goal in mind. <br><br>


<h3>Step №2: Plan your daily routine</h3><br>


A comprehensive approach is necessary to achieve your goal. Efficient trainings should meet a number of requirements:<br><br>


<b>Energy.</b> You should have enough rest and nutrition prior to your training. With no energy your capabilities to do the job are limited. Extreme cases – on an empty belly in the morning and after a hard day in the evening – are not the best options. If your lifestyle can’t give you the possibility to work out to the full, you should adjust your goals accordingly. You should also have the hardest training on a weekend, train at your working place etc. You can find ways to train everywhere! Work in a warehouse? Use racks fot chin-ups and pull-ups! Do a set of these every hour. Free your imagination and you will find ways!<br><br>


<b>Diet.</b> You should have an opportunity to have meals at work, thus preparing your boxes with food beforehand. This is the most important requirement which is a must for trainings.<br><br>


<b>Rest and sleep.</b> This one is clear by itself.<br><br>


<h3>Step №3. Identify the structure of the training programm and choose the exercises </h3><br>


<b>Identify your current physical level.</b> This can help you to choose your training routine. The beginners (let’s say up to 8 pull-ups) should train the whole body during 1 training session, 3-5 sessions each week. At this level you can’t intensively train 1-2 muscle groups, therefore split training is not reasonable. At intermediate level you can switch to split training system. 2 muscle groups (or 2-3 exercises) can be trained for 1 session at a standard rate. This method is the more efficient. Here the recovery takes longer, and 2 sessions for one muscle group each week are enough.<br><br>


<b>Choose goal-oriented exercises.</b> If you are thinking about overall physical condition (this is exactly what should be done after our 100 Days Workout programm), then tyou should stick to the basic compound movements. You should also train all muscle groups evenly, thus the exercises should be balanced. 2-3 basic exercises for a muscle group are the best option.<br><br>


Overall physical condition means that all complex basic exercises should be at the beginning of the session, because here you should apply all your strength and energy.<br><br>


The session starts with a warmup focusing on those joints that will be extensively involved into training. The session ends with cool down. Just like you did during our programm. <br><br>

<h3>Step №4: Plan your training routine for 1 week</h3><br>


You should spread the load evenly for all exercises and balance different exercises by complexity. You should also calculate the overall load per week to progress. <br><br>


<h3>Step №5: Execute the program</h3><br>


<h3>Step №6: Analyze</h3><br>


Analyze the combination of the exercises, training time and other parameters. If everything is ok, then plan your training routine for 2-3 weeks. Increase the load in volume linear or in circuits (see a screenshot diagram):<br><br>
