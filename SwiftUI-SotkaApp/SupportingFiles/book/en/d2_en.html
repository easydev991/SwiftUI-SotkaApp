						<h2>Warming-up</h2><br>
						
We know that you might have no desire to warm-up and that you want to begin the training itself as soon as possible. But believe us, if there are no injuries in your plans, warming-up is a <b>NECESSARY</b> part of any training. We will explain why in today's infopost:<br>

<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">The advantages of warming-up:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">1. It prepares your cardiovascular system for the upcoming training.<br>
2. It prevents the premature production of lactic acid.<br>
3. It raises the temperature of muscles, ligaments and connective tissue and reduces the risk of injury.<br>
4. It makes muscles faster, stronger and more flexible.<br>
5. It allows you to diagnose problems or individual limitations in the early stages of training.<br>
6. It sets up your mind on the training mood.</div>
</div><br><br>

<h3>The main principle of warming-up</h3><br>

The warm-up should be purposive! This means that you should stretch and warm up those parts of the body that will be under load. Of course, jogging and squats or jumping rope before pull-ups are also the warm-up techniques, because they increase body temperature, prepare all the body systems for training, etc. But these are too general. It is much better to stretch all the joints, ligaments and muscles that will participate in the pull-ups (back, arms, neck, shoulders, etc.).<br><br>


The harder the training is going to be, the more attention you should pay to the warm-up and to the preparation for it!<br><br>


<h3>How intense should the warm-up be?</h3><br>


According to recommendations you should use a load that raises your pulse to 90–120 beats per minute, but the warm-up must feel moderate in difficulty. Your main task during this part of the workout is to “warm up" your body and prepare it for load. They often use the moment of sweat appearing as a measure of a “warmed-up” body. But here everything can also depend on the conditions in which you train.<br><br>


<h3>How long should the duration of warm-up be?</h3><br>


Duration of load, as mentioned earlier, depends on the complexity of the upcoming training. Therefore, it is necessary to focus not on time, but on how you feel. After the warm-up you need to be on full alert!<br><br>


Usually, a warm-up takes 3-5 minutes before light trainings, and 10-15 minutes before heavy sessions or if there are any other reasons for increasing the duration of a warm-up.<br><br>


<h3>What are the types of warm-ups?</h3><br>


Actually, there are lots of ways to warm up before training, so as time passes, each of you will be able to choose the one that is most suitable for you. Well, in SOTKA, our main goal is to get you to know the various options for warm-up.<br><br>


<b>1. Articular exercises</b><br><br>


Here you can see a warm-up set by <b>Max True</b>:<br><br>

<b>2. A simulating warm-up</b><br><br>


If you plan to train with weights and iron, it will be useful to perform all the same exercises using lighter weights. Alternatively you can do light body weight variations of the same exercises as a warmp-up. For example, you can do the Australian pull-ups before the the standard pull-ups. Anotehr example is doing pushups before dip bar exercises.<br><br>


<b>3. Shadow-boxing</b><br><br>


The third good way to warm up is the so-called "shadow-boxing" (it was famous for showing the training regimens of the action stars in the 90-ies). One of the main advantages of this type of wrm-up is the variety of exercises (according to  the ability to improvise in the process) and the inclusion of the whole body , not just its separate parts.

<h2>Cooling down</h2><br>

Remember: even when you have done the last repetition in the last circuit, the training is not over yet!<br><br>


It would seem to you that you’ve warmed up well, then trained hard, and that you can now fall on the couch with a clear conscience, but in fact there is one last thing to do. You need to have a short cooldown in order to calm the body after the training and bring it back from an excited state to a resting state.<br><br>


The cooldown is very important because it allows you to make the transition process smooth, avoiding body stress, which can occur with a sudden transitions from the active work to the resting state. Moreover, sometimes these sharp switchings cause dizziness, weakness and even fainting!<br><br>


<h3>Why is it so important to cool down?</h3><br>


1. It helps to normalize the work of the cardiovascular system through the relaxation of working muscles.<br>
2. It normalizes the level of adrenaline in blood and attenuates blood pressure.<br>
3. It prevents the possible negative consequences of the transition from the active mode to the resting state.<br><br>


<h3>Duration of cooldown</h3><br>


We would recommend that you always consider your own feelings. The main thing is that your pulse and breathing have to return to a calm rhythm. Usually, the duration of a cooldown is 5-10 minutes.<br><br>


<h3>Intensity of  cooldown</h3><br>


This characteristic is directly connected with the intensity of the previous workout. Your main task is to move smoothly from the training itself to the cooldown, and from the cooldown to the resting state. Thus, throughout the cooldown, the intensity should gradually decrease, along with your heart rate.<br><br>


Finally, it should be added that cooldown can be different. Depending on your condition, you can just quietly stretch up, or you can do a couple of your basic exercises, performing them with less intensity or in simplified variations.
