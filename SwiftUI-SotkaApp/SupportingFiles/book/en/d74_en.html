If you would ask any athlete what he/she would like to train first, except for the muscles, majority will immediately name one extremely important organ which is responsible for our sports achievements and the quality of our life. So, we are sure to talk about...<br><br>


<h2>Heart</h2>


<img src="../img/74-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


Heart is a large muscle organ, to be more exact, it is one large muscle. And this muscle is in mediastinum (together with the organs of the chest) at a neurovascular bundle, that is, the heart has one attachment place.<br><br>


Heart and other muscles are different in structure, and we are interested in one different feature – blood supply.  The muscles are penetrated with vessels and capillaries, while the heart can’t have such a blood supply due to its functions. For example, heart doesn’t have vessels inside, because this could affect contraction – heart cells which are close to the inner cavity receive nutrition right from the blood which goes through it.<br><br>


There are less vessels inside the heart muscle than in usual skeleton muscle, because it is important for the heart to get maximum from a square unit – this is the muscle which works all day long and all life. However, this is not the problem, because the heart muscle is very thin, and as outside the heart is intricately covered with vessels and capillaries, it has perfect blood supply. <br><br>


<h2>Two types of exertion</h2><br>


Just like any other muscle, our heart responds to the exertion on heart in a particular way. Heart exertion can be of two types.<br><br>

<b>Volume exertion.</b> Blood runs to the heart from the body and stretches it. Under standard conditions the exertion is not great, while with physical exercises it significantly increases. Skeleton muscles are contracting during a session and work like a pump to fill the heart with blood. If the blood flow is great, and exertion lasts for hours, then the heart, just like any other muscle, start stretching – like a stretching session.<br><br>


When the whole heart stretches and increases in volume, then its walls don’t become thicker, while the volumes of chambers increase. This is similar to blowing a balloon – it becomes larger under exertion.<br><br>


If these loads last for a long period of time (regular cardio-sessions within several months or years), then the heart remembers the way it stretches, and it increases in volume. The positive effect from this increase is that the heart can eject a far more amount of blood per one heart beat. At the same time the number of heart contractions decreases – this is one of the reasons why the pulse rate among sportsmen is lower at rest than it is among common untrained people. <br><br>


Heart stretching is trained by the cardio-exercises with 100-150 pulse rate (typically 100-130). This is the range of heart contractions when exertion causes the heart to eject the maximum amount of blood. By the way, this is exactly why the exercises are called cardio ones, from cardio meaning “heart” in Greek. <br><br>


<b>2. Resistance exertion.</b> There are several main situations when the heart must pump the blood with certain efforts, or when its capacities are lower than the desired exertion::<br><br>


а) If the body muscles are tense due to an effort or static exertion, then the heart must pump blood with a significant effort to overcome the resistance of the skeleton muscles. <br><br>


б) It the pulse rate is high (180 and higher), then the heart can’t completely relax and be filled with blood, and it works too fast.<br><br>


в) If a person has an excessive weight (no matter whether it is due to fat or muscles), and the heart has to pump the blood through a massive body. The only benefit of hypertrophied muscles in comparison with hypertrophied subcutaneous tissue is that these muscles work in the appropriate manner, and the heart is under volume load, it means it stretches.<br><br>


These situations are characterized by acidification in heart, which results in hypertrophy (that is, the fibers of the heart muscle thicken), although the heart itself increases in volume, but the volume of its cavities doesn’t increase, it means that a blood volume per minute doesn’t increase. On the contrary, it may even decrease – hypertrophy occurs both inside and outside (heart wall thickens as well), which additionally decreases the volume of heart cavities. In simple words, one contraction of a stretched heart means 2-3 contractions of a hypertrophied heart, that is, the heart has to work more – every minute, every day, all life, mind that. This can somehow shorten the life.<br><br>


Second point – when the heart wall thickens, it becomes more difficult for the blood to penetrate into the heart, and the heart experiences shortages in oxygen and nutrients. At the first stages shortage of oxygen results in additional heart hypertrophy, thus increasing its volume, although over time this can lead to dystrophy (painful muscle relaxation due to insufficient nutrition) or the death of cardiac myositis because of ischemia – in fact, a heart attack.<br><br>


<h2>Heart and training</h2><br>


That is why popular interval workout sessions can be harmful rather than beneficial when they are inappropriately done. Although many amateurs are not appropriately prepared to make the heart beat with 180 beats per minute, still you should be careful with these loads.  <br><br>


Many cardiologists don’t recommend their patients to do strength training, because for heart this training can be compared with a highly intensive interval training with muscle resistance. But still with the right approach to the training process weight training is not dangerous for heart. Cardio-exertions with moderate intensity level stretch the heart, but they are not enough for routine body functioning – heart doesn’t work alone.<br><br>


With strength training you should avoid significant straining efforts and a long heavy weight holding to beat the record. This is just an example. At least not at every session! Give your muscles and your heart some rest. Intermingle hard exercises with light ones or have a combination of two opposing exercises – this can help to pump out the blood from the muscle that has just worked and to decrease the heart load.<br><br>


<h2>Conclusion</h2><br>


How can we understand whether the cardiovascular system and the energetic systems of the body are properly developed? First of all, your body should physically be able to withstand a long exertion (for example, running for 3-5 km or vigorous cycling for 30-40 minutes). Let me remind you that sport standards are developed for age groups rather than for body constitution – therefore, we should think of training our body in a proportional manner (naturally with due regard to specialization – you can’t be both a sprint athlete and a marathon runner, the same analogy can be drawn for a body builder and a marathon runner).  <br><br>


The second factor is a pulse rate at rest (it should be measured in the morning when you’ve just awaken and are staying in bed). If it is about 60-70 beats per minute, it is ok. If it is lower than that, it is perfect, but with higher figures it’s time to make some changes in your life.<br><br>


Visiting a cardiologist is surely a good thing to do once or twice a year – getting an electrocardiogram and ultrasound investigation of your heart won’t take a lot of time, but this can tell you a lot about your heart.
