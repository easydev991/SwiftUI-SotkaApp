This  infopost is devoted to answers to the most frequently asked questions related to our program. If you have a question that is not answered below, you can always ask it using <a href="https://t.me/sotka100app">Telegram</a>.<br><br>


<b><h3>What should be done before starting the program?</h3></b><br>


1. Using a unicolored background, take some photos of the front of your body, the back part of your body, both sides of your body, and of yourself in a swimsuit. Be sure to use natural light. Be as relaxed as possible in these photos, and don’t strain your muscles. <br><br>

Seriously, if you don’t do it now, then at the end of the program you will regret that you don’t have any ‘Before’ and ‘After’ pictures.<br><br>


2. Carefully look at the video showing a demonstration of the basic exercises (push-ups, pull-ups, squats).<br><br>

                </iframe><br><br>

That is exactly how you need to perform the exercises when you test your current maximums at the beginning of the program. Testing should be carried out using the same procedure: first pull-ups, then push-ups, then squats. Don’t forget to warm up before you begin! <br><br>

You have access to many posts providing detailed information about the correct technique for these exercises. At the end of the program, you will be able to notice how much your motor skills have improved.<br><br>

3. . Measure your weight and body dimensions (neck, chest, biceps, waist, hips, thighs, forearm, lower leg).<br><br>


4. Determine the goals you want to set for yourself in this program. If possible, express them in specific numbers. There will be a separate infopost about setting the goals in the program..<br><br>


<b><h3>Are there any contraindications for completing the program?</h3></b><br>


The only contraindications are standard medical ones. The information we provide is only for educational purposes (as it is). You are fully responsible for your health. Therefore, <b>always consult your doctor before starting</b> a program (preferably a sport doctor).<br><br>


We want you to develop the ability to listen to your body while engaged in your training sessions, because your body is the best source of feedback and it is important to learn how to understand its signals.<br><br>


<b><h3>Is there a necessity to buy any equipment for trainings or body and horizontal bar will be enough?</h3></b><br>


You need only your own body and a horizontal bar (or its substitute) for trainings. Also think in advance about where and how you will train in case of adverse weather conditions outside.<br><br>

<b><h3> Should I change my nutrition during the program?</h3></b><br>


Yes. If you want to achieve significant results, then only trainings won’t help you with it. NO! We will focus on this issue in details during the second week of the program.<br><br>


<b><h3>Previously, the program consisted of exercises X, Y, and Z, but can I replace X with X1 in my workouts?</h3></b><br>


We recommend you to start SOTKA program according to the plan we offer. If in the future you realize that your body isn’t getting a good enough workout, you can always replace the exercises with more difficult versions. We will discuss this topic in details in the ADVANCED program block.<br><br>


<b><h3>What if I can't even do a single pull-up?</h3></b><br>


There will be a detailed infopost about doing pull ups in the BASIC block of the program. In the meantime, you can do Australian pull-ups as an alternative:<br><br>

<b><h3>Is it possible to combine SOTKA with a gym workout or other types of training?</h3></b><br>


The training sessions will last about 30 minutes per day. They are intense, but short. To maximize their effect, we recommend that you move your body more often than you usually do in the remaining 23 hours and 30 minutes. You can take the stairs more often, park your car a little farther from your place of work and walk to the building, take breaks every hour, and warm up. These are all small actions, but their effect will accumulate!<br><br>


As for combining our program with other types of training, just evaluate your well-being. If you are asking this question, most likely, you still don’t know the capabilities of your body and the level of your strength. They can only be determined empirically; the most important thing is to not overdo it.<br><br>


<b><h3>What if doing any exercise causes pain?</h3></b><br>

Remember the main rule - we never do something that causes pain. NEVER! There is no need to endure pain, no need to do something through pain. If suddenly something starts to hurt, then immediately stop doing it. You will learn more about it in our BASIC program block.<br><br>


<b><h3>Where will be held the trainings for beginners? How will I find out the time of training?</h3></b><br><br>

Every day at 00:00 we will publish a new infopost with information and training tasks, so you will be able to train when and where you feel comfortable.<br><br>

As for offline meetings, you can get information about them on the page of your city or on the city forum. In some cities we have Curators of the program, who will hold weekly offline meetings.<br><br>

<b><h3>What if I can’t train every day?</h3></b><br>

First, it is necessary to analyze the reasons why you wouldn’t be able to train every day. Our experience with previous programs shows that anyone can find some time to practice, if he/she wishes to do so..<br><br>


The program gives you 1 day of complete rest from the trainings (you are free to choose any day in the week for this) and 1 stretching day, which is assigned to the last day of the training week; however, you can also do it during the weeks when you cannot train as required.<br><br>


In general, you should strive to complete 6 out of 7 training days each week.<br><br>


<b><h3>What if I miss a few workouts for some reason?</h3></b><br>


Nothing terrible will happen if you have to miss 1-2 days for some reason; moreover, you can safely continue training when you be able to do so.<br><br>


In the case of a longer absence (2+ days) or compelling reasons, we recommend that you return to training beginning from the last day you did so. Eventually, it is important to get the best result possible, and not to just go through the program. <br><br>


The program has a separate infopost dedicated to returning after the break.<br><br>


<b><h3>What if I get sick or injured?</h3></b><br>


First, in case of illness or injury (which affects your workouts), you <b>must stop</b> practicing until you recover. Illness/injury is stressful for your body, and you don’t need to create even more stress in the form of physical exertion.<br><br>


Second , in this case it is not necessary to be disappointed, because none of us is safe from such things; thus, we must react to them more calmly. SOTKA is not just a 100-day workout event; it is a way of life. Once you start practicing, it will be difficult to give up. So, you can safely spend a little time recovering and return to training fresh.<br><br>


While you are recovering, we also recommend that you enjoy your free time; for example, you can read a book, learn a foreign language, learn how to play a musical instrument, etc. <br><br>


<b><h3>Should I make repost so that more people know about the program?</h3></b><br>

We will be very grateful for your help in promoting the program on social networks and among friends. Ultimately, our goal is that as many people as possible learn about how to be stronger, healthier and more beautiful with the help of workout and without any financial costs!

The official hashtag of the program is <b>#SOTKA</b>.
