We have prepared an unusual infopost for you, because we believe that you should definitely watch a speech by <b>Ben Goldacre</b> at <b>TED</b> Conference, where he very quickly explains how one can distort the arguments starting from very evident cases with food up to tricks in pharmaceutical industry.<br><br>


This is important, because many of us get accustomed to trusting the so-called “studies” which in fact are ordered and financed by the manufacturers, which allows them, in fact, control the findings of the studies and manipulate them.<br><br>


Here is an interesting and informative video:<br><br>

<h3>How to distinguish real science from fake science?</h3><br>


As you can see during our program, we stand for both physical and mental development of the trainees. Originally, <b>100 Days Workout program</b> has the status of an educational program, therefore, we would like to share some recommendations on choosing the books and articles to receive the most qualitative information and not to be hooked by the pseudo-scientists.<br><br>


You can also use the questionnaire below developed by Evgenii Eidelman, Professor, Head of Department of Physics, Saint-Petersburg State Chemical Pharmaceutical Academy.<br><br>

<b><h3>Questionnaire</h3></b><br>

1. Has the author received a higher education in the area of the topic? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
2. Does/Did the author belong to any academic community (while doing a master’s course, doctor’s degree, etc.) in the area of the topic? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
3. Has the author published any papers in academic reviewed journals in other topics? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
4. Has the author published any papers in academic reviewed journals in the area of the topic (name 2-3 publications)? Yes (0) No (2)<br>
5. Are there any overviews on this topic made by the specialists in the reviewed journals (name at least one)? Yes (0) No (2)<br>
6. Has the author got any references from the outstanding specialists in this area (RAS members, etc.)? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
7. Does the author cite the appropriate papers published in the reviewed journals in his/her works? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
8. Have the works on the topic been carried out secretly or in the open manner? Open (0) Secretly (1)<br>
9. Was the aim of the source to make a fundamental discovery in this area? No (0) Yes (2)<br>
10. Do the author’s publications contain the acknowledgements to other people for the discussion of the findings? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
11. Have the author’s studies been supported by the academic funds: RFBR, INTAS, Сороса, CRDF? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
12. Can the information described by the author be presented in the terms of the textbooks used in the secondary schools and at the first years of the university? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
13. Does the author reject the conventional theories? No (0) Yes (2)<br>
14. Is the information verified by other specialists? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
15. Does the author ground his/her arguments about the validity of his/her information on overall philosophical or methodological issues? No (0) Yes (1)<br>
16. Does the information given by the author bring any dramatical changes in the life of the society? No (0) Yes (2)<br>
17. Should the information given by the author be implemented within the existing rules and procedures? Yes (0) No (1)<br>
18. When should the results given by the author be implemented? In the future (0) Right now (1)<br><br>


<b><h3>Interpretation of the result</h3></b><br>


1. If you answer No to the questions 1-6 more than four times (4 and more scores), the source is not reliable. And there is no need to interpret the answers to other questions.<br><br>


2. If A fails, but the questions 1-12 are given the answers from the second column more than six times (6 and more scores), the source is not reliable. And there is no need to interpret the answers to other questions.<br><br>


3. If B fails, but all questions (1-18) are given the answers from the second column more than ten times  (10 and more scores), the source is not reliable.<br><br>


Of course, there criteria are not 100% valid, because the notion of pseudoscience is difficult to define, and it is defined in every particular case. In some cases it can be impossible to see the difference not being a specialist in this area. But more often than not you can get rid of rubbish. And, finally, here is an example which is rare for pseudoscientists. Typically, pseudoscientists speak simple language, while the science uses words difficult to understand, but here it is clearly seen that we can’t exclude the situation when a phreak can behave differently.  <br><br>


<b><h3>Dr. Fox effect</h3></b><br>


This effect was found in a research examining the students’ evaluation of the teacher’s lecturing skills. Surely, this effect can be observed not only in a lecturing room.<br><br>


Let’s look at the experiment which helped to discover Dr. Fox effect.<br><br>


An educational conference invited specialists with PhDs in Medicine and Psychology. Myron L. Fox, a lecturer with PhD (that’s why he was called a Doctor) gave the lecture. The topic of Dr. Fox’s lecture was Mathematical Game Theory as Applied to Physician Education. But in fact, the role of Dr. Fox was played by an actor. He was instructed to prepare for this lecture: he put down several scientific terms and phrases from academic papers. These terms and phrases were then used by the actor with no logic and content consideration. The actor acted the role of an expert in front of the students being lectured. The speech given by “Dr. Fox” was meaningless, but sophomoric and was accompanied with emotional and non-verbal markers of specialists and friendly attitude to the audience. The actor was very skillful at making good impression and remained in this image of an expert.<br><br>


After the lecture, the listeners (who were specialists in this field of scince) were asked to evaluate the content and the usefulness of the lecture. As you can guess, they gave very high marks to the lecturer. Pay attention that Dr. Fox’s lecture was evaluated not by the students, not by common people, but rather by the scientists with PhDs in Medicine and Psychology…<br><br>


Here is a full video:<br><br>

Dr. Fox effect explains the success of many speakers who speak sophomoric rubbish, but do it in a kind, warm and expert manner. Dr. Fox effect makes many pseudoscientific lectures, videos, papers and books popular.<br><br>


Just like this actor, the pseudoscientists take the terms and phrases from academic sources and are not even aware of their meaning and distort the context. New sophomoric terms also add to this effect of Dr. Fox. Pseudoscientists extensively use these terms and phrases in meaningless and contradictory statements and deliver them to their followers in a warm and friendly manner.<br><br>


This Dr. Fox effect presents rubbish as very valuable discoveries, sells air and different pseudoscientific recipes, involve people in training pyramids. It should not be forgotten that many harmful companies, for example, totalitarian destructive religious sects, Dianetics type psychocults, use these popular lectures to make new people join their organizations. If you are aware of Dr. Fox effect, you can understand why this method is efficient. <br><br>


Dr. Fox effect will work, and the listeners (readers, viewers) will comprehend this outrageous stuff as Revelation of some kind, if<br><br>


1. The context is appropriately chosen. A speaker gives his/her regalia, and the event itself is presented in a respected way – a meeting with an expert, a scientific conference, a superefficient training, a kind of a marathon, etc. <br>
2. The speech (text) of the speaker contains academic or sophomoric terms and statements. No matter whether they are logical and connected with each other<br>
3. The speaker behaves as an expert: he/she speaks confidently, does not rush, gives new information in an about-scientific form.<br>
4. The speaker is friendly, makes good impression, jokes at the right time, looks right into the eyes of the listeners, smiles, etc.<br><br>


How to avoid Dr. Fox effect?<br><br>


1. Write down what you are being told to check it later. Do not make any decisions until you check the information. <br>
2. Don’ t be afraid to ask silly questions. You’d better be laughed at or be removed from the room than be fooled.<br>
3. Try to reformulate sophomoric terms and statements into simple everyday language. Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues said: “When a thought is too weak to be expressed simply, it should be rejected”.<br>
4. Think why you go to the meeting (lecture, training), watch a video, read a book. What results would you like to receive? See whether you are dealing with self-treatment. Seek for advice from the specialists.<br>
5. Be aware of the fact whether that is your decision to visit the event, or you are persuaded into it.<br><br>

Some may think that it is all rubbish, that it is clear, but statistics in our country illustrates the contrary situation. Unfortunately, a major part of population is still hooked by the pseudoscientists and is fooled by the phreaks’ tricks.
