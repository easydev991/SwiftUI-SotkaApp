We know from the ads that not all yogurts are good for our health, and from our 100 Days Workout programm you will know today that not all muscle fibers are similar to each other in our body.<br><br>


Sure, you can train with your own experience and empirical knowledge (sometimes this is exactly what should be done), but it is also important to understand what underlies empirical results. Here you should know some theoretical aspects, and today we will start a series of posts about session workouts with the scientific grounds, with due regard to physiology and biochemistry. We’d like to say from the very beginning that there are two main classifications of muscle fibers: by contraction rate and energy supply. Let’s look at each of them in detail....<br><br>


<b><h2>Contraction rate based classification of muscles</h2></b><br>

Generally speaking, muscle fibers of skeleton muscles are of two types: slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers. Their correlation in the bodies of different people could be different. For example, if there are more slow-twitch muscle fibers, then a person is likely to become a short distance runner, while if there are more fast-twitch muscle fibers, then a person is going to become a sprinter. This is genetically determined, and nothing can be done with that.<br><br>


<b><h3>Type I: Slow-twitch muscle fibers (red)</h3></b><br>


Here fiber contraction rate is quite slow, although the muscles can continuously contract for a long time due to oxygen oxidation (we’ll speak about it below). <br><br>


Red fibers of small diameter are surrounded with a huge amount of capillaries (small blood vessels) and are myoglobin protein rich which stores oxygen and gives it to mitochondria (in fact, it transports oxygen), unless the blood transports enough blood. Many mitochondria (energy stations, see below) of red fibers have a high level of oxidized ferments which help them transform carbohydrates and fatty acids into energy.<br><br>


<b><h3>Type II: Fast-twitch muscle fibers (white)</h3></b><br>


The contraction rate of these fibers is quite high (40-100% from the maximum), although they are not supposed to work for a long time due to some peculiarities in their energy provision. Energy is supplied by anaerobic glycolysis (see below), and this mechanism works for a short time (about 60 seconds). <br><br>


White muscle fibers have a large diameter, they have a large amount of glycogen (complicated carbohydrate consisting of glucose and being the energy reserves of the body), while there are not enough mitochondria. Glycolytic ferments prevail in the body (dividing glycogen into glucose – the main source of energy for the body).<br><br>


White muscle fibers are subdivided into Subtype IIа and Subtype IIb.<br><br>


<b><h3>Subtype IIа (intermediate fibers)</h3></b><br>


These muscle fibers can use both oxygen and oxygen-free substance exchange as an energy supply mechanism. In fact, these fibers are something in between fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers (from 25% to 40% of the maximum contraction).<br><br>


<b><h3>Subtype IIb</h3></b><br>


These are fast-twitch muscle fibers, they use oxygen-free substance exchange only. They don’t have myoglobin protein, but at the same time they have the maximum strength and contraction rate. <br><br>


<b><h2>Energy supply based classification of muscles </h2></b><br>


Adenosine triphosphate (ATF) is the main energy source for all cell structures. ATF is known to be a universal energy source for all biochemical processes in living systems. ATF is obtained from all other sources which a person can’t use in a direct way and can use only ATF to top up the stored energy. This can be compared with the processing of different types of fuel – coal, turf, diesel, etc. into electricity which can then be used as an energy supply source for everything.<br><br>

Once ATF storages in the muscles are completely used, which happens for a couple of seconds, the body starts to look for the sources to top up ATF storages and to continue working.<br><br>


Creatine phosphate (CrF) is the first source for resynthesizing ATF. This mechanism of energy supply is called creatine phosphokinetic. Its storages in the muscles increase ATF storages several times, still this is not enough (about 5-15 seconds). We may say that this source is a kind of a battery with small energy charge. However, when the energy of creatine phosphate is used, free creatine ad free phosphate are released. They stimulate the activity of their mechanisms of energy supply.<br><br>


These mechanisms could be divided into two groups:<br><br>


- oxygen free (anaerobic)<br>
- oxygen based (aerobic)<br><br>


We will try to explain each of them in simple words. Let’s start with anaerobic mechanism. Here is its diagram:<br><br>


<img src="../img/73-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


Once creatine phosphate (CrF) is over, the body starts to use glucose stored in glycogen to generate ATF molecules which will be used to top up creatine phosphate reserves. And creatine phosphate, in its turn, will cover the ATF stock which will be used for the muscle fibers to work. <br><br>


At the same time, pyruvate (pyruvic acid, a product of glucose metabolism) and hydrogen ions are generated. If the body couldn’t handle the neutralization of the growing number of hydrogen ions, then they accumulate and cause a burning feeling in a muscle. You are likely to experience this feeling when performing exercises. It should be pointed out that once accumulated the hydrogen ions destroy the molecules inside protein, which can results in protein destruction.<br><br>


Maximum accumulation of hydrogen ions is the threshold which limits the time to use his energy supply mechanism. To express this in figures, it requires about 60 seconds.  <br><br>


Now let’s turn to the second mechanism. Aerobic glycolysis can be illustrated as follows:<br><br>


<img src="../img/73-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


In comparison with the previous mechanism, this diagram included a new element called mitochondria. In fact, they are the energy stations of cells with the main function being oxidation of the organic compounds and the use of the energy freed after their disintegration for ATF synthesis. <br><br>


Thanks to them, pyruvate which is generated during glycolysis process will not transform into lactate, which results in hydrogen ion accumulation, but rather will be sent inside mitochondria and will be turned into CO2, H2O and ATF molecules which will be used to recover the reserves of creatine phosphate (CrF). And since hydrogen ions are not formed, the medium doesn’t become oxidized, and the muscles could contract for a long time.<br><br>


To make it even simpler, our endurance depends on the number of mitochondria in cells: the more mitochondria there are, the more endure we are and the more reps, for example, can be performed. <br><br>


<b><h3>Types of muscle fibers: GMF and ОMF</h3></b><br>


Muscle fibers with a small amount of mitochondria which supply energy in an oxygen-free method are called Glycolytic Muscle Fibers (GMF).<br><br>


Once the number of hydrogen ions reaches maximum, then muscle fibers stop contracting, and a person feels local fatigue. <br><br>


Muscle fibers with many mitochondria which supply energy in an oxygen based method are called Oxidative Muscle Fibers (OMF). They are not oxidized, and it means that they will never be tired. Besides, aerobic glycolysis is 18-20 times more efficient that anaerobic one since 38 ATF molecules rather than 2 ones receive glucose from one molecule!<br><br>



And now two pleasant moments:<br><br>



1. In comparison with fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers (FTMF and STMF, respectively) muscle fibers are not genetically determined by glycolytic and oxidizing principles. <br><br>



2. The number of mitochondria in a muscle fiber could be increased! This is exactly what should be done if you want to do more reps in exercises. But this should be done within particular borders which are genetically determined. <br><br>


<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>


Now you know that your muscles consist of two types of fibers which are designed for different types of work. One type of fibers are used when the body needs much strength in a short period of time, while the other type is used when you don’t need a lot of strength, but this strength needs to be applied for a long period of time. Thus, to be appropriately developed you should include exertion for both types in your sessions (while the focus of exertion should be purpose dependent).<br><br>


If the genes can’t be modified, then the situation is reverse in case of energy supply for the muscle fibers (and endurance). OMF number could be increased. Here you need appropriately compiled sessions, and we will talk about it in infoposts to come!
