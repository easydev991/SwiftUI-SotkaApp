Congratulations for the successful completion of the <b>“SOTKA”</b> first week! Over the past seven days we talked in details about all the components of our training in the framework of the BASIC block, we discussed the necessity of warm-up and cooldown, learned to perform basic exercises correctly (pull-ups, squats and push-ups) and even started to train flexibility.<br><br>

<h2>Balance of calories</h2><br>

The first thing we would like to tell you about is the concept of the "balance of calories", without which all your attempts to get in shape will be more like dancing with a tambourine around the bonfire, rather than a systematic movement towards the goal. Speaking simply, all that food you eat during the day has a certain energy value, which is usually measured in calories. These calories are spent to ensure the viability and stored in the body for the future. And this ratio between the number of calories gained and burned will determine the changing of your weight, whether it’ll fall, rise or stay put.<br><br>

<h3>How do we spend calories?</h3><br>

Putting in a nutshell, the calorie consumption can be divided into two groups: ensuring the functioning of the body and everything else. In the first case we are talking about the huge amount of different processes that occur in our body (in organs, tissues, cells), and which we do not think over, but which require energy. The simplest example is the work of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. All of these processes must occur in the body (this cannot be avoided), and the number of calories spent on all these processes is called <b>the basic metabolic rate.</b><br><br>

Now let's talk about on what else the calories, which our body receives, are spent:<br><br>

<b>1. On the work of the nervous system. </b> Although the brain is only 1-2% of the total body mass, it can consume up to 25% of the total ingested energy.<br>
<b>2. On the work of skeletal muscles. </b>  Even at rest, they continue to consume energy, so a muscular person, even when not moving, spends more calories than people of similar weight but with less muscle.<br>
<b>3. On the digestion.</b> The Internet has a quite widespread myth that split meals speed up metabolism due to the fact that the digestion of each meal wastes some energy. The problem is that the differences here will be minimal, and we can see it in Physics. To digest 1 kg of food you need a certain amount of energy, no matter on how many parts this kg will be divided. On the other hand, if you eat a large portion at a time, it may take even more energy because for a body such a large amount of food will become the additional stress which you’ll have to tackle.<br>
<b>4. All the other stuff.</b>  In this group there are a lot of different things, mostly associated with maintaining homeostasis. For example, if you are cold, then the body begins to spend calories on heating, and on the contrary, if you’re overheated, it starts the cooling processes, which also requires calories. There are a great bunch of examples, and although the contribution of individual items may be small, but the following amount is large enough to consider these charges in the calculation.<br><br>


We hope that you got a definite comprehension of the spending all the energy that you get from the food you eat, and why some people can eat more than others and not get fat. Of course, there is still an influence of genetics and hormonal system, but we will talk about them later during our program.<br><br>


<h3>Determination of balance of calories </h3><br>


Most of us already have the current eating pattern associated with our daily routine and our habits. Again, for the most part, our weight is more or less a constant value. This is connected to the fact that we consume almost the same amount of calories per day which we spend. Here the most interesting part begins. If you want to lose weight, you must reduce the amount of consumed calories (for about 10-15%), if you want to gain weight, then you need to increase this number (also for about 10-15%). The efficiency of your digestive tract (gastrointestinal tract) and level of metabolism still plays a role here, but we leave this point for the ADVANCED block.<br><br>


After reading the last paragraph you may have a question: how can I determine my balance of calories? On the Internet you can find many different calculators and complicated formulae to determine the number of calories you need to consume at a certain age and a certain way of life. As a result we are given some average number, the origin of which is quite mysterious. In my opinion it's all quite unclear, especially when there is a method much simpler and more accurate. If we agree that your daily diet is approximately constant volume (within the week/month, it’s fairly enough for the majority of people), then it is possible to calculate its caloric value. On the other hand, on the Internet you can find as well a huge number of different formulae for counting the number of calories you burn throughout the day, depending on your lifestyle, and your weight, and your activity etc. But these formulae will also be averaged and inaccurate. There is a simple, obvious, and user-friendly equation:<br><br


<b>The changing of weight = The number of calories received - The number of calories burned</b>  (considered over a definite period of time)<br><br>


That’s all! There is NOTHING more to be invented. Do you want to lose weight? Reduce the amount of calories. Do you want to gain weight? Increase the number of calories obtained. Here some people may argue that with the help of this formula one can lose weight and by increasing burned calories, but there is a moment that in the beginning of SOTKA an average participant(which weight is 80kg) burns about 100-150 kcal, and by the end of the program he will burn up to 500 kcal. 100 kcal can be replaced by one or two apples. 500 kcal is a small piece of cake. Therefore, the effect of exercise can be displaced without your thinking.<br><br>

<h2>Calorie concentration of foods</h2><br>


Back to the main topic, the calorie content allows you to bring down the complex composition of our food to a common denominator. So, 1 gram of proteins or carbohydrates gives us 4 kilocalories, and 1 gram of fats provides 9 calories. So all you need to do to determine your calorie balance is simply to count the calories of all those products which you consume during the day.<br>

<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">IT’S IMPORTANT!:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">The calorie content of the product is always considered while it’s being dry/raw/uncooked. Despite the fact that in the process of cooking grains absorb water, and, for example, a piece of meat gives the water away, in most cases, the ratio of proteins, fats and carbohydrates remains the same. That is, 50 grams of dry rice provide the same amount of proteins, fats and carbohydrates that 200 grams of boiled rice.</div></div><br><br>


Information about caloric content of various products can be easily found from the public sourses. But if you are lazy to sit with a calculator and count yourself, there are a lot of websites offering similar services on the Internet. There are also plenty of apps for mobile devices, which can be very useful to count the number of calories consumed! But nothing is more convenient and practical than the good old table in Excel.<br><br>


<h2>Food diary</h2><br>

After reading you should get two key points: the first one - the food gives you the calories that can be counted; the second - in order to reduce/increase the weight, you need to disrupt the balance of calories in one direction or another. I know that the calorie counting is not the most exciting thing in the world, but it must be done, if you really have a goal to change yourself. There is a saying - "you cannot manage what you don’t measure", and for our situation it fits as a fiddle!<br><br>


One can often hear from people (even in our forum these topics often appear)something like "I eat like an ox, but I can’t gain weight" or "I don't eat anything after six, but the weight does not go away". Believe me, if you don’t calculate, your approximate estimates actually can be very far from reality, and that is why you can not achieve the desired goal!<br><br>


So, the next week you are to go and write down everything eaten throughout the day, to analyze, and to determine the balance of calories and make conclusions. You want to lose weight - you reduce calories, you want to gain weight – you increase their quantity.<br><br>


<h3>Some notes for the last</h3><br>


As the balance of calories is the total number of calories consumed per day, so, it’s not so important how many meals you have per day. Your main task is to receive the necessary amount of calories and to ensure that their ratio was roughly this: Fats 15-30%, Proteins 10-15% Carbohydrates 55-75%. It is not a dogma, but simply a rule recommended by many organizations in the field of health and nutrition (including WHO), giving the approximate ratio from which you can start. Further, depending on your goals you can change the ratio of consumed proteins, fats and carbohydrates.<br><br>


In addition, you need to ensure that your diet was diversified and included various sources of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, as well as fiber, vitamins and minerals. It’s better to keep in mind that your body has certain limitations of the amount of proteins, carbohydrates and fats it can recycle per meal in its favor (Previously I wrote about the efficiency of the digestive tract). Thus, it would be better to divide evenly your calories into several meals.<br><br>


Well, the next few days we will dedicate to a detailed review of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, but before that, for clarity, I propose the following metaphors:<br><br>


<b>Proteins</b> are the bricks to build our body.<br><br>


<b>Fats</b> are like tree, which can be used directly for construction, for example, it can be used for making the walls and for energy production, i.e. it can be burned. It is also important that the tree can be stored and stocked up.<br><br>


<b>Carbohydrates</b> are the energy, or “electricity”. You can’t stock lots of it, although something can be stored in batteries, but in all cases, when the energy is needed, the body uses carbs firstly, as they are best suited for these needs.<br><br>


<b>Vitamins and minerals</b> are like the gemstones that are needed in some industries. Let's say the diamonds needed to create complex and durable tools. It’s not necessary to have lots of them, but without them the body cannot cope.<br><br>


It should be noted that our body is able to convert some nutrients into others. It can synthesize from carbohydrates any other carbohydrates and some fats, from fats – other fats and carbohydrates etc. But its capability in this matter is quite limited.<br><br>


In other words, proteins can only be produced from other proteins, and not from fats and carbohydrates. Besides, there are some amino acids (components of proteins), some fatty acids (part of fats) and also some vitamins that the body can't synthesize. They are called essential, and you can get them only from the outside, along with food. Essential carbohydrates do not exist –our body can get it from any other types of nutrients.<br><br>


Continuing our metaphor, for the normal management a body needs stones and trees, and a small amount of diamonds. They need to be high quality and decent origin. In order to process them and transform one into another, there should be a sufficient amount of energy. The main thing, there must be just enough amount of everything, and a number of valuable, irreplaceable resources should be ingested constantly.</div>
