Time flies, and though it's hard to believe, we have successfully reached the middle of our education program! We seem to have started it only yesterday, don't we? Well, we are at the halfway point, still half way is ahead. Last week we learned about the tempo, the ideal technique, the perfect duration of a training session, some new ABS exerxises. In addition, we tested new maximums and learned the history of workout.<br><br>


Though 50 days is quite a number, we are picking up the pace! As we tested new highs yesterday, today you can have a well-deserved rest. Well, for you not to relax too much, we have prepared something completely new in the ADVANCED block!<br><br>


We feel the ADVANCED block needs some variety. But it should be a useful variety able not only to reduce psychological fatigue of a certain monotony of the circles, but to improve your final results.<br><br>


So we have decided to implement two innovations to achieve these goals. First, we would like to suggest replacing the circuit training by the workouts based on doing sets. Second, starting from the second week of the ADVANCED block we will be introducing a new advanced technique for our exercises. And we suggest trying it.<br><br>


Now let us focus more on each of the points.<br><br>


<b><h3>SETS Training</h3></b><br>

A circuit training is not the only option for your training sessions. That's the reason (+ to improve your final results) we have decided to shift from circuits to sets within the ADVANCED block. Before you performed all exercises one after the other with some rest only between circuits. Now you will complete all pull-ups first, then all squats, then all pushups, then all lunges. It will be a bit more complicated, so read the recommendations below carefully and follow them by all means!<br><br>

<b>SETS Training is a way to add intensity and diversify the program. If you feel that standard load is enough for you, you don't need to change anything in your workout.</b><br><br>

Main difference between these two training aprroaches is that the new one is more muscle building oriented, while the previous one was more about your overall endurance and improving your cardiovascular and raspiratory systems. <br><br>

<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">NOTE!</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body"><b>1.</b> Keep rest periods between sets in each exercise WITHIN 60 seconds. That is, do the first pull-up set, have a minute rest, do the second pull-up set etc. At the same time a rest period shall not be less than 30 seconds. The rest period between exercises is SIMILAR.<br><br>


Please note that the training will last 1.5-2 times longer.<br><br>


<b>2.</b> The number of sets in each exercise is 6, but since the work load has changed, we would recommend that you return to the starting number of reps in each set, and then increase it, if you find that too easy. Within the ADVANCED block it is very important to learn to assess your strengths.<br><br>


<b>3.</b> If doing an exercise or a set you can't perform the required number of repetitions, this set is considered to be the last for this exercise. THE MAIN THING is DO NOT WORRY IF IT HAPPENED!<br><br>


This limit is introduced mostly for you to be able to recover in 24 hours between training sessions to keep training every day. So if you fail to choose the right number of reps, (it is likely in the beginning), the limit will protect you from overtraining. At least that's what we expect.<br><br>

<b>4.</b> If you realize at some point that the ADVANCED block work load becomes excessive, you can always get back to your regular training and standard techniques for a few days. You can alternate the circuits and workouts based on doing sets, as well as standard and advanced techniques throughout the week. Anyway, you can have some creative input here as we all are different, and we still have too few statistics on the ADVANCED block to give you universal recommendations!<br><br>

<b>5.</b> If at any point you see that you can easily add 2 reps in last set in any exercise, then you can try to add 1 rep in each set. For easier variations of exercises these numbers would be 4 and 2 accordingly.</div></div><br><br>

Good luck!
