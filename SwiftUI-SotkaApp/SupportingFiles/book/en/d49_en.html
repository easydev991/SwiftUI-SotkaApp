Today is the last day of the BASIC block and this means that it is time to take a look at the intermediary results and achievements.<br><br>


<b>First of all</b>, we think, that it might be interesing to find out your new maximums for each exercise. This is why I advise you to test yourself today, also, if you want, you can do it only for those exercises that you are interested in.<br><br>


Here is our idea how to perform a test for maximum. Warm up thoughroughly and do the first set with 30-50% of your possible maximum. Then rest for 5-10 minutes to calm down the heart and nervious system and make another go for 100%. I have tried this with pull-ups, and can tell you that this scheme is safe and does not interfere with your maximums. If it works for pull-ups it must work for other exercises too.<br><br>


For example, if your suggested maximum is around 10 then it is worth doing two warm-up sets of 3 and 6. If it is about 8 then you might as well warm up with 4 and then go for 8. Anyway, try to listen to the body. For instance, with maximum of 25 I would go for 10 and then 25 but if the maximum is 30, then I would do 10-20-30.<br><br>


 think you might as well agree that it feels better to know your stable new maximum, than your accindent one time maximum, right?<br><br>


<b>Secondly</b>, we want to make our program more effective and useful, so please, fill the form and give us some feedback. May be we lacked something important in BASIC block, may be you want to add some topic to infoposts, or remove some, or move to the earlier days. Feel free to write us your thoughts, because we reed all comments and do our best to improve the program.<br><br>

<b>Thirdly</b>, the ADVANCED block is already waiting for you, and here is a short preview of what's coming up next:<br><br>


- We will once again review all the basic moves (pull-ups, push-ups, squats and lunges) as well as we will present 2 new exercises and give you information how to increase your maximum reps!<br>
- We will once again discuss the topic of nutriotion, but on a more advanced level (sport nutrition, alcohol, hormones, etc.)<br>
- We will cover up a bunch of interesting topics regarding how your body is working in general and muscle systems in particular. <br>
- We will share information, needed for independent development after the end of the program<br><br>


So we have hell lot of interesting things coming up. ADVANCED block would be ineteresting not only for beginners, but for advanced athletes with several years of experience as well. So don't be shy to share the link to our APP with your friends and social networks!
