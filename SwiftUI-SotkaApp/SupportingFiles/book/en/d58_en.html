It is time to tell you about one of the most difficult topics in our program. Our discussion will uncover many processes in our bodies. Please, get prepared, it is not going to be easy but exciting!<br><br>


Let’ start with the most important thing, all processes in our body are constantly controlled by two systems: nervous and humoral systems. Probably you’ve heard a lot about the nervous system, as for the second one, we should speak about it in detail.<br><br>


<b><h3>Humoral regulation</h3></b><br>


It is one of the mechanisms regulating the life processes through liquid media of the body (blood, lymph, tissue liquid, saliva) with the help of hormones emitted by the cells, organs, tissues. Hormones are chemical combinations which transfer a particular signal. In fact, this process reminds radio transmission with a transmitter, on the one side (which sends hormone-signal), and a receiver, on the other side (which can identify the right signal from this or that hormone). When the signal is received, a new combination appears which impacts other substances of the cell, particular chemical reactions are triggered, which results in synthesis (anabolism) or separation (katabolism) of the substances which are necessary at the moment. <br><br>


ANABOLIC hormones include, first of all, insulin, sex hormone, such as testosterone and estrogen; growth hormone and hormone of thyroid gland. KATABOLIC hormones are adrenalin, cortisol (stress hormones), glucagon, growth hormone. The latter performs two useful functions. It is responsible for fat tissue separation and for protein tissue synthesis.  <br><br>


The things mentioned above make us conclude that the result is determined by the amount of hormones which the body releases into the blood (strength of signal) and the number of receptors in the corresponding tissues (power of receiver). For example, why should we stay away from the products with high glycemic index? Because the body can respond by releasing a lot of insulin in blood so that the glucose level in blood will fall below the normal level with particular circumstances.<br><br>


How can receptors impact the hormones? It is very simple. Let’s look at insulin. How does insulin work when it is connected with the corresponding receptor? It changes the permeability of the cell shell for a glucose molecule, and it freely enters the cell and is spent on the energy needs. Let’s consider 2 situations. On the one hand, here is a man suffering from obesity and leading a sedentary lifestyle, while, on the other hand, here is a man with a normal body weight, developed muscles and active lifestyle.<br><br>


In the first case, the muscle tissue cells have small number of receptors sensitive to insulin, but there are a lot of them in the fat tissue cells. This is an adjustment reaction to the fact that he uses muscles less and stores the fat very extensively. For the second case, the situation is contrary, there are many receptors of insulin in the muscle cells, and there are a few of them in the fat tissue cells. What happens if both of them eat one apple from a vacuum package? Both will have sugar level raised in the blood, and the corresponding amount of insulin will be released in the blood. However, the man with obesity will have his fat cells released to store glucose (remember, there are a lot of receptors), while the second man will have his muscle tissue cells opened because he has more receptors there.<br><br>


This partly explains the situation when someone eats and does not put on weight, while for the other person a salad is turned into fat, no matter what. Because in the first case everything goes to the muscle where you can’t store a lot because they try to spend the incoming glucose – this person is very active, energetic, full of beans all the time, while in the second case the body has a huge amount of receptors in the fat tissue, and the muscles just can’t compete with the fat tissue for the glucose in blood.<br><br>


<b><h3>HNT (hormones, nutrition, training)</h3></b><br>


Resetting of the main metabolic and regulatory processes also results in strengthening physical and psychological health, which can be achieved due to a reasonable comprehensive approach. Nutrition should be both balanced in calories (+/- 300-500 Kcal to lose or to gain weight) and appropriately balanced in protein, fats and carbohydrates (for example, 20-20-605 and it should contain sufficient amount of fiber). Physical activity, in its turn, should combine three load types: anaerobic exercise for strength; intensive cardio exercises (for example, interval training) and moderate and low intensity cardio exercises.<br><br>


A reasonable diet to lose weight provides the decrease in the number of calories; the increase of sensitivity to leptin and its stabilization; less boosts in insulin released and increase of cell sensitivity to it. The main task of the workout sessions in this context is to change the balance of hormones in the body and receptor sensitivity in the cells. Physical loads increase muscle cell sensitivity to insulin.<br><br>


It is not always a good idea to increase the body’s energy expenditure – if you don’t improve the hormone profile along with the hormone sensitivity of cells. Becayse this way the only thing you will get in a long distance is that fat will become stored in difficult-to-train places (remember about the balance of receptors to insulin and cortisol), destruction of muscle tissue and a fall in the level of the main exchange (which can be characterized as slowing down of the substance exchange) that will be achieved in the long-term perspective). An attempt to impact the weight aggressively with a huge amount of cardion is similar to inappropriate low-calorie diet – you can see the results in the short terms, but these results will bring a lot of problems in the future. Cardio impose positive impact on cardio-vascular system and many parameters of the body, but they do not solve all the problems connected with slowing down metabolism.
