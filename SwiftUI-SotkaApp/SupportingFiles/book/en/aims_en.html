Before you begin our SOTKA program, let us introduce you to the goals which we set to all our participants.<br><br>


<h3><b>Goal #1: Create a training habit</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\aims-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


To us this is the most important goal in the program. Believe it or not, but it is much easier to maintain training regime every day than to train occasionally from time to time. So the hardest step is the first step. You just need to start and after a while you will see your training sessions as a part of your daily routine.<br><br>


<b>SOTKA</b> was created, in the first place, for the beginners, that is why we developed a training program around bodyweight exercises which could be perfomed anywhere and anytime. Our moto - maximum workout availability! Still, the structure of the program allows you to adjust its training volume to your level of physical conditioning the way you will be able to recover in 24h. So we just eliminate all the possible excuses. Also, such approach makes you independent of fitness club, bad weather or any other outer conditions.<br><br>


But 100 days is just the beginning. We are concerned that everyone, who will successfully finish our program, would have an irresistible desire to continue his or her training. One will decide to stick with Street Workout, one will transfer to bodybuilding or fitness, one will take the dream sport and so on! Physical development is a life long road!<br><br>


<h3><b>Goal #2: Improve physical conditioning</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\aims-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Our next goal is to improve the physical conditions of every participant and increase the numbers in 3 basic exercises: pull-ups, push-ups and squats. Unlike the previous goal this one is much more specific and could be measured in numbers.<br><br>


Respectable numbers for Men in bodyweight exercises:<br><br>


- pull-ups - 20-25 reps<br>
- push-ups - 80-100 reps<br>
- squats - 150-200 reps<br><br>


Respectable numbers for Women in bodyweight exercises:<br><br>


- pull-ups - 10-15 reps<br>
- push-ups - 30-40 reps<br>
- squats - 100-150 reps<br><br>


You can ask why we don't got for 200 push-ups and 500 squats for example? Of cause you can set such goals, but if you ask us, it would be much more effective to transfer to more advanced exercises:<br><br>


- pull-ups -&gt; muscle-ups<br>
- push-ups -&gt; dips<br>
- squats -&gt; jumping squats<br><br>


That is in general, and if we talk about the actual results our graduates have reached, then we can talk about the following numbers:<br><br>

<b>Pull-ups</b><br>
If you start with less than 10 pull-ups, by the end of the program you can double up the number!<br>
If you start with more than 10 pull-ups, by the end of the program you can increase them by 50%!<br><br>

<b>Push-ups:</b><br>
If you start with less than 25 push-ups, by the end of the program you can double up the number!<br>
If you start with 25-50 push-ups, by the end of the program you can increase them by 50%!<br><br>

<b>Squats:</b><br>
If you start with less than 30 squats , by the end of the program you can triple up the number!<br>
If you start with 30-100 squats, by the end of the program you can increase them by 50%!<br><br>


<b>!!! IMPORTANT NOTICE !!!</b> We DO NOT GUARANTEE that you will achieve such results, but we DO GUARANTEE that it is possible, because this is the median numbers base on the statistics for tens of thousands of participants of our program. So it is only up to you! <br><br>

Also, we will work on your flexibility and will teach you about proper stretching and make you love this kind of training! Everyone who does strength training on a regular basis, has also to do stretch training and flex!<br><br>


<h3>Goal №3. Build knowledge base</h3><br>


<img src="..\img\aims-3.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Actually, SOTKA - is an educational program and not a training program. That is why you will find no ready-to-go answers and secret shortcuts. Instead, we will give you insights on how your body is working and how different things are interconnected, so you will have a full picture by yourself. We would not stop only on biology, but we would also share with you topics on physics, chemistry, time management, philosophy and many more!<br><br>


So everyday during our program you will not only spend on training, but also on educating yourself!<br><br>


<h3><b>Goal #4. Change appearence</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\aims-4.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Of cause it is great to become stronger and healthier, but let's not forget that a lot of people start their fitness journey with a goal of improving their appearence and becoming sexier versions of themselves. We really understand that, and we will provide you with all the necessary information to reach that goal! <br><br>


And the very first thing you have to know about this goal is that training only would not bring you the results you need. You have to pay attention to your food regime and dieting habits. Hopefully all the second week of our program would be dedicated to this topic!<br><br>


<h3><b>Goal #5. Find new friends</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\aims-5.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


We can assure you that at this very moment tens of thousands of people all over the world are going through our SOTKA program. And with our app we can provide you with unique possibility to meet new like-minded persons and go from day 1 to day 100 together with them! This also works as a great stimulus and motivation for productive training!<br><br>


<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3><br>


In the end, we have 4 main goals and 1 additional goals, which we would try to reach during our program:<br><br>


1. Create a training habit<br>
2. Improve physical conditioning<br>
3. Build knowledge base<br>
4. Change appearence<br><br>


5. Find new friends
