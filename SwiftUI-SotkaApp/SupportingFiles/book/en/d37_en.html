One of the few things in the world more inscrutable to us than tons of junk information about fitness on the Internet is the amount of naive people too eager to buy into it. Today, we are going to debunk another myth that went viral and embedded into the thinking of all fitness newbies. If today is not your first day on the web when you are looking up on how to get yourself in shape, you might be already aware of three body types: ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph. Well, there is not such a thing as three body types. Let's start.<br><br>

<h3>Poor definitions</h3><br>


In a nutshell, ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph are nothing but exotic counterparts names of what we are more used to: thin, middle-weight, and fat. And these counterparts terms ARE NOT in any way scientifically substantiated. Wary? Let’s check the definitions:<br><br>


<<img src="../img/37-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">Classification:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body"><b>Ectomorp</b> - characterized as tending toward linearity; thin, usually tall; with little muscle; narrow chest, etc.<br><br>


<b>Mesomorph</b> - characterized as athletically built; with muscular chest and shoulders; heavily muscled arms and legs; and minimal body fat.<br><br>


<b>Endomorph</b> - characterized as tending toward roundness; with a round head; a large, round abdomen; large internal organs relative to his size, rather short arms and legs; fat upper arms and thighs, but slender wrists and ankles.</div></div><br><br>


Sounds like a big deal, doesn’t it? Whose sick imagination would bring forth such fruits?<br><br>


The author of this classification is William H. Sheldon who observed human body and tried to find any correlations. However, those were not biology or anatomy studies that lay in the domain of his interest. Far from it – he was a psychologist. Hence, his three main body types – ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph – are nothing but three categories of appearance. Bluntly put, his theory has no specific sense except of that stirring the pot for those too susceptible or tenderfoot. Which we are going to discuss now.<br><br>


Besides that the whole internet is flooded with links to the body types, it is also flooded with different special training plans specifically for ectomorphs and mesomorphs, as well as diets for hardgainers (a buzzword applied by bodybuilding adepts to ectomorphs) and stuff like that. We can only guess how many people refer to themselves as to ectomorphic hardgainers who find it extremely tough to bulk up, while, in fact, they just do not eat enough and never track their caloric intake. Or how many people think they should fall into the ranks of endomorphs prone to gaining weight, without having a clue of how many carbs and proteins they eat and of what they eat at all. Meanwhile, the thing is simple as that – we've already posted on a caloric balance before – it doesn’t matter if you are thin, medium-weight or fat; diet and training principles (GENERAL PRINCIPLES, not specific approaches, schemes or plans) are the same for everyone. These are like physical laws. Gravity affects us all, though it affects fat people more than thin ones (in proportion to the difference in weight). But it does affect everyone and everywhere!<br><br>


To sum up, categorizing people into thin (ectomorphs), medium-weight (mesomorph) and fat (endomorph) does not make any positive sense in terms of changing your physiques. Whereas, there is a set of ANTHROPOMORPHIC factors that determine the way you look and how much effort it will take you to change your appearance.<br><br>


The first one is how long your muscles and tendons are and where their attachment sites are located. Some people have long muscles and short tendons, others – vice versa. Thus, it is easier for the former to train muscles, which will look more aesthetical as well.<br><br>


The second factor is general length of your limbs and body. All trainings are based on physics – the shorter the lever, with other things equal, the heavier the load you can apply on it. Needless to say, gradual increase in training load is one of the methods to cause stress to the body to which it will have to adapt.<br><br>


The third one is your weight and height. Someone of 80 kilos and 180 cm (176 lb and 5'9 ft) looks rather different from someone of 80 kilos and 170 cm (176 lb and 5'6 ft). But it doesn’t make you an ectomorph since such categorizing is an EFFECT but not a cause. By the way, next time someone tells you genetics doesn’t decide, don’t hesitate to tell them to shove it up. You bet, it does decide.<br><br>


Above are the most popular three parameters that do differentiate people. But in fact, there are way more parameters of the kind. It’s individual parameters you should consider when you make up your training plan instead of following some murky theory coined by a psychologist and parroted by gym junkies.<br><br>


<b>P.S.</b> FYI, categorizing female body shapes (apple, pear, triangle, rectangle, inverted triangle) is a part of the similar stuff.</div
