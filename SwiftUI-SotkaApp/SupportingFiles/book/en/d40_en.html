No matter how much time can you find per day to train, but you always must find enough time to rest! Because good rest is a key to success.<br><br>


<h2>Rest</h2><br>


                                                  <img src="../img/40-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>
												  
												  
												 
												   
												   
I don't think that it is necessary to once again remind you the importance of rest itself, so I will say a few words regarding resting after working out. May be for some people this would be big news, but in reality when you do train you do hurt your body, you destroy it instead of making it better. A good training sessions creates a stressful situation for your body, so it will have to mobilize it forces and find a way to overcome it.<br><br>


Talking about muscles in particular, when you give them a bigger load than they have adapted, you create a demand for them to grow. Though they only grow AFTER training when you give them time to grow. But if you wont give yourself enough rest then each next training session will make you weaker, than you were even before!<br><br>


Rest during rest days can be divided into two main categories: active rest and passive rest.<br><br>


<b>Active rest.</b> If you are quite active during your everyday life, then I'm more than confident that you already have enough active rest between your training days. If you go to play football with your friends, or go hiking or somekind like that - it's all can be described as active rest. The main difference between active rest and strength training is that you dont load your muscles to their limits. You are active, you are moving, but your body has adopted to such level of training load so it's not perceived as stress.<br><br>


<b>Passive rest.</b> Everything that can't be related to active rest falls into this category. Watching a movie in cinema, reading a book, going for a walk with a friend and so on. It may be rather difficult for people who only begin working out to stay in a given regime, beause they are constantly thinking about training and getting results as soon as possible, not giving enough time to rest. By the way you can spend your rest time on very useful activities which are not related to sport at all.<br><br>


Answering the questions which type of rest should be more preferable, I can say that it's all very individual and depends on a bunch of factors which makes your life. You can find a lot of information on the net about the precise time your muscles have to rest between trainings, about the precise time you have to train, how many sets and reps you have to do and that you can't train everyday and so on. But I always give out one advice - listen to your body! During our 100KA program one of our main goals is to teach you to listen to your body and understand what it is trying to tell you. Because no one in this world would know you better than yourself! And all this information on the internet, at its best, is average.<br><br>


Also I would like to remind you that our 100KA program is designed the way that you would sucessfully recover in 24 hours between training sessions. This is achieved because we don't do reps till failure. There would be a lot of infoposts during <b>ADVANCED</b> block about different training principles and techniques, which require more time to rest, but any way, it's all individual .<br><br>


<b><h2>Sleep</h2></b><br><br>

How important it is to have enough sleep to get good results? Believe me it's really THAT important! Imagine a mobile phone which is working all day long, with all those additional stuff like WIFI, GPS, Internet and so on. Even with cutting edge technologies nowadays such phones would have enough battery only for like 12 hours. What happens when? You have to put it on a base overnight to recharge. This is quite similiar to whatever happens in your everyday life to you (not just to your phone)!. So if you would not have enough rest and recharge your batteries, you would not be able to use your abilities on 100%!<br><br>

Sleep is a key component of your rest, this is why, ideally, you should always get enough sleep. Why? Because when you are sleeping, your body is producing high amount of growth hormone, testosterone and neurotransmitters. Also lack of sleep leads to the production of cortisol (stress hormone) which accelerates the catabolistic processes. In other words - sleep is good, no sleep is bad!
<br><br>

<b>Here are 4 simple advices for whose who have problems with sleep:</b><br><br>

1. Nurture the habit to go to sleep at the same time everyday. It may be difficult at first, but as the time passes the power of habit itself will make you easily go to sleep.<br>
2. The very beginning of sleeping is characterizing with decreasing activity of body, so you can make it easier to fell asleep if you will behave more calmly, you can take a bath or listen to some relaxing music before going to bed.<br>
3. So called "fast" carbohydrates (we have talked about them on the second week) also have "sleepy" effect on you (which is clearly felt right after lunch), so a small meal before going to bed would be good.<br>
4. Don't watch TV or sit in front of PC before going to bed, because the streak images are stimulating your visual nerve and, respectively, your brain, making it harder to fall asleep.</div>
