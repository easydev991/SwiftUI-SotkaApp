Now it is time to touch upon one of the most ambiguous topics arising a lot of debates. We can’t avoid discussing the sports nutrition and supplements, and we have already claimed that <b>your body is the reflection of your lifestyle.</b>. With that in mind today we will share our opinion about sports nutrition and different supplements and try to explain why their inclusion into a diet is justified ONLY in a limited number of cases and for some categories of people.<br><br>


<img src="../img/61-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


This post is, first of all, devoted to the supplements which are aggressively promoted in the Internet and the magazines as a solution for people who are rushing to get a better physique. Protein shakes, gainers and fat burners are the most popular additives among other supplements. We haven’t carried out any marketing research, but we believe that these three things occupy a lion’s share in the manufacturers’ revenue. However we will also say a few words about creatine, caffeine, vitamins and mineral additives, as well as about the substances increasing a buffer blood amount.<br><br>


We do not plan to look at the supplements in terms of their impact on your health in a long-term perspective. Unfortunately, up till now this issue hasn’t been thoroughly studied, therefore there are only some findings concerning creatine and caffeine. We will not trust the information provided by the manufacturers, because in the 1950s America saw a lot of studies justifying positive effects of tobacco smoking. A bit later they started to consider the connection between tobacco smoking and cancer of lungs... So, here we are quite skeptical about the supplements, but still everyone should decide on his/her own. We are talking about the fact that actually the promoted substances absolutely can’t solve your problems.<br><br>


<b>Is it possible to achieve excellent results without any supplements? Only with calisthenics and proper nutrition?</b><br><br>


Yes, it is possible. And we know a lot of examples when such results have been achieved. Was it difficult? Yes, a lot. And the stronger your desire to look better is, the stronger you want to be, the more time you need for trainings and your nutrition. There are no miracles, only hard work. But at least Street Workout makes your work more interesting and varied. Before we proceed, we would like to remind you some infoposts about <b>calorie balance</b> and <b>diet as a lifestyle</b>.<br><br>


If you believe that you are lacking better results due to the lack of macro- and micronutrients or ergogenic supplements, then you can find here information about additives.<br><br>


We identify 3 categories of products which typically refer to sports nutrition depending on their effect:<br><br>


1. Goods typically called sports nutrition (drinks, bars, gels, powders).<br>
2. Additives increasing sports results (creatine, caffeine, sodium bicarbonate, beta-alanin, nitrates).<br>
3. Medical supplements (ferriferous, calcium, simple and complex vitamins, fish oil).<br><br>


<b><h3>CATEGORY 1 – Sports Nutrition</h3></b><br>


This category includes proteins, gainers, different bars and drinks. In fact, a protein can is a huuuuge box with 1000 eggs or 100 liters of milk or 10 kg of cottage cheese with a 3-liter jar with jam in a beautiful package, and the ingredients are just mixed with water.<br><br>


Therefore, the goods from this category are efficient if they fit into your nutrition plan (if you have none, probably it would be better to prepare this plan and only then think about the supplements?). Their main purpose is to gain macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates), if further consumption of regular food becomes difficult or brings discomfort. For example, when preparing for a triathlon, a daily intake should be 5000 kcal a day which means 5 kg of porridge a day. It naturally involves highly energetic goods). And what if there is no available sources of omega-3 fat acids in your area? As for disadvantages, they are high price of usual food and possible inappropriate consumption.<br><br>


<b><h3>CATEGORY 2 – Supplements for better sport results</h3></b><br>


Generally speaking, these substances widen “a narrow bottle neck” in exchange processes at the cell level. In other words, our bodies contain these substances in a limited amount, which gives us an ability to perform work. An external intake in the form of the supplements increases our ability to work longer, to resist fatigue (creatine, beta-alanin), or to decrease its judgmental comprehension (caffeine). As a result, you train more and, theoretically, achieve better results and get progress faster. Naturally, intrusion into biochemistry at the cell level is a serious matter, that’s why the intake of these supplements should be regulated by the specialists. You can face both idiocrasy (stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting), and the effects typical for this medicine (skin sensitivity loss for beta-alanin).<br><br>


<b><h3>CATEGORY 3 – Medical Supplements</h3></b><br>


This category includes:<br>
- vitamins<br>
- drugs of mineral substances-microelements<br>
- antioxidants<br>
- complex drugs of the above mentioned groups<br><br>


The products from this category are prescribed to eliminate a deficit in sportsmen’s bodies (for example, ferriferous supplements can be prescribed to the women due to blood loss in a menstrual cycle or for sportsmen’s training in high mountains to increase the number of erythrocytes). With no doctors’ prescriptions (which are based on the results of the medical blood analysis) the intake of the medicine may be counterproductive, because the overuse, as well as the underuse of the substances can be harmful (you can google vitamin deficiency and hypervitaminosis). American College of Sports Medicine Recommendations as of 2015 firmly claim that a deficit in a substance should be treated with a targeted medicine, not with a polyvitamine medicine.<br><br>


<b><h3>Why do people buy sports nutrition medicine?</h3></b><br>


Let’s say a beginner wants to gain mass (possible options – to lose weight, to increase strength, to have more endurance and etc.), but he/she can’t achieve this result. He/She has training sessions twice a day and eats a lot. However he/she does not have any training journal nor nutrition plan. This situation is widely spread among the beginners, isn’t it? But we know that there are no miracles, and the problem in this situation is that he/she has calorie deficiency. That is he/she either hasn’t got enough nutrition, or trains too much. Unfortunately, he/she doesn’t understand that. He/she believes that he/she has already used his/her genetic abilities to the full, and it’s time to consider taking some sports nutrition products. All these ads cry out about it and are very persuasive in providing the guarantee to gain mass in the shortest time.<br><br>


Let’s say that he/she is hooked on these attractive offers and buys a can of protein or gainer and starts taking it. What does it give? Probably, now he/she receives extra calories which are helpful in adding to calorie proficit, and thus he/she starts to gain mass. It seems to be a success, but it’s not so simple, because …<br><br>


<b>His/Her results will increase ONLY until he/she takes sports nutrition products. And ONLY in the case when this factor is the only one preventing him/her to be developed, while the other factors are ok.</b> <br><br>


If you doubt whether to take sports nutrition products, I would highly recommend reading the statement in bold above one more time.<br><br>


Calorie proficit arises due to additional intake of sports nutrition products, therefore a refusal to consume them makes further growth impossible, and probably (depending on a daily intake in comparison with usual food) results in gradual return to the results which match your lifestyle. This is inevitable just like the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. And even if you know a couple of stories when people stopped taking sports nutrition, and their results remained stable, then probably the reason should be looked for among other factors. <br><br>


In the end, the choice for a beginner is limited: either be hooked by the marketologists of the manufacturers until he/she wants to look “good” (conventionally), or be at a loss why after the withdrawal of sports nutrition products he/she again returns to the previous results. I’d like to point out that the companies that manufacture the sports nutrition products will be absolutely glad if he/she chooses the first option because this brings them a constant cash inflow from the purchases.<br><br>


<b>Our beginner has no idea of proper nutrition, the ingredients of the products, the amount of calories, etc.</b><br><br>


No matter how hard you train, it is impossible to achieve any proper results without appropriate nutrition. Therefore, in several weeks, months or even years of inefficient tryings (for example, to gain several kilos of mass), our hypothetical beginner just gives up his/her attempts to achieve the desired results.  You can often observe similar situation among the fitness club visitors who can train for months and do not achieve any (none!) results. Because they don’t take any attempts to understand how their body works.<br><br>


<b>We can understand why athletes take sports nutrition products, because they can’t always satisfy the needs just by usual food, especially during the competitions, relocations, etc.</b><br><br>


This is an attribute of their profession, the rules of the game which they must play, if they want to receive the maximum physically possible results. But even they do not always achieve the result that can be seen on the photos, in the Internet or on TV during the competition broadcasting. Athletes overcoming their thinkable and unthinkable abilities are at the peak of their career for a very short time (sometimes just several hours) and can’t preserve their conditions for even a month. For several months-years they are training for a particular competition or a particular photo session where they must show their best. We are not going to blame anyone, just take it as a fact that high-performance sport does not exist without steroids. If there is a professional sportsperson (or an ex-sportsperson, they discuss this topic more willingly) among your acquaintances who are ready to share the information, speak with him/her.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">An interesting fact:</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">To have a good cover photo, you should make a couple of thousands of photos (more than 700 for one cover with George Gregory Plitt, I saw the original shots) with the best one being chosen from them, and then this best photo is processed at the computer. Unfortunately, this is the main idea of fitness industry which sells you a method to become the one on a beautiful cover which, in fact, does not exist. </div>
</div><br><br>


If you are planning to train for yourself, then we recommend you to think twice whether you really need these supplements. Or you just try to find a quick solution to a long-term problem? In the latter case we want to disappoint you that there is no such a solution, and it means that if you want to achieve results, then you should change yourself and your lifestyle. Well, again it gets us back to infopost about <b>diet as a lifestyle</b>.<br><br>

If you are still doubtful whether to rely on a magic pill, powder or not, then here is one more argument AGAINST sports additives. Even in the USA and European countries the manufacturing of sport supplements are poorly regulated, and they don’t have strict requirements like, for example, in case of pharmacological substances. As a result, only a manufacturer knows what is inside a can with a desired protein or fat burner, and there can be any stuff, including anabolic steroids, diuretics, antidepressants, etc.
