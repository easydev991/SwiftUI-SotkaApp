As the entire next week will be solely about training, today we decided to talk about spending our leisure time. And we would like to share Anton's story with you:<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote_head">Anton</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Several years ago, when I was a sophomore, I got into a complicated situation with my studies. I’ll omit the fact that I managed to graduate from school with As and Bs and enroll in the university, but not without trouble. I did not work out at that time, so I had plenty of free time, but I was not a brilliant student. Although I managed to complete my first year with average results, by the middle of the second year it became clear that I needed to bridge the fundamental knowledge gap of the key subjects and generally the subjects that they taught me.<br><br>


A side thought. I believe the process of studying at the university is extremely simple – all you have to do is to know the answers to the exam questions. That’s it! If the exam is solely based on exam questions (and 90% exams are), then there is no problem passing it, because you can prepare beforehand. Presenting the exam questions is a carte blanche for the students – I still don’t get why many of them won’t use it.<br><br>


Let’s go back to the middle of the second year. It occurred that I was presented with dumbbells, and I even used them a few times until I injured my elbow and abandoned them for good, and the book by John Adair “Effective Leadership & Motivation” (a wonderful book that set me on a path of self-improvement) at the same time. Around that time, I read that IKEA founder likes to split his day into small timeframes to increase efficiency. Below I present his full quote:<br><br>


<i>You can do so much in 10 minutes’ time. Ten minutes, once gone, are gone for good. Divide your life into 10-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity.”<br>
- Ingvar Kamprad, Founder of IKEA ($23 bln net worth)</i><br><br>


That idea intrigued me, but I understood that 10 minutes is too small a period, so I decided to split my day into hourly units (60 minutes) – I bought a timer that looked like a hen (perhaps even made by IKEA). This way I was able to control my studies and switch activities every hour. At that time, I switched subjects, because I needed to catch up with my groupmates. It looked something like that:<br><br>


1 hour – studying Psychology<br>
1 hour – training<br>
1 hour – rest<br>
1 hour – studying Econometrics<br><br>

And so on. I wasn’t much into parties and stuff like that at that time, I didn’t like to take walks and didn’t chat a lot with other people. Thus I could entirely concentrate on my goal.<br><br>

However the text above is only an introduction to the infopost. After some time of such daily routine it occurred to me I was only consuming things made by people before me, but I did not create anything for others. And it struck me like lightning. I realised that I must not only consume, but also create. When I say “create”, I don’t mean any global stuff, I mean the things anyone can do. It is especially easy if do something you like – you simply need to find out what you actually like to do.<br><br>


The easiest way is to produce information – start an online blog. Say, you are keen on radio electronics and can assemble a boombox. Write about it! You’ll be surprised to see how many people with similar interest there are, who are looking for this information and couldn’t find it before. Or, maybe you like to play all newly released games distributed via Google Play or AppStore. Why not write some reviews, that can help other people make their choice? These examples mostly concern hobbies, because your hobby is what you really like to do and love doing. But you can try to apply this to your job and qualification!</div><br><br>


I must say that the time we live in is ambiguous: on the one hand, you can be absorbed by abundance of information; on the other hand, it is very hard to find really useful and relevant information. Have you ever tried to count how many websites about your subject and advice from experts there are? And how many of them do you find truly useful?<br><br>


Furthermore, the current state of things provides countless opportunities for generating content, not only consuming it. Earlier the only opportunity was to create a website and wait for the first visitors to find it. Social networks have revolutionised the Internet and now hundreds of thousands of people can learn about really interesting things instantly. Want another example? Instagram (a social network for sharing photos) + love of cooking = photo blog with various recipes, and who knows – maybe there is a cooking talent lying dormant inside you?<br><br>


Creativity is an integral part of any human being. Meaningful labour made the monkey into Man (I adhere to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution), and those people who have been constantly creating everything, i.e. inventors, have created the world we all live in. It is not perfect, there are plenty of problems, but, I believe, it is much better than it used to be, and the existing problems are simply challenges to you personally!<br><br>

<b>P.S. They say that the best way to comprehend something is to try explaining it to other people. Believe me, it really is so.</b></div></div>
