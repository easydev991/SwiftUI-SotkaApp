This is the final infopost for ADVANCED block, because tomorrow we start TURBO block where... where you will get tons of new and exciting stuff, but you have to wait a little bit for it.<br><br>


Our 100 Days Workout program ends up in just 10 days... As it is said, everything good is coming to an end sooner or later, and our program is not an exception from the rule. It means that in a bit more than a week we will congratulate you on the completion of the program. From the very beginning, our main goal was to give you the basic set of skills and knowledge that will be helpful in your further training. And we believe that all our infoposts and answers to your questions have successfully fulfilled this task.  <br><br>


The program was not enough to cover everything in fitness and Street Workout. We may say that we just give you some bits and pieces from a new fascinating world with a huge number of exercises, different types of fitness/sport, training programs, methodologies and approaches, and not to forget nutrition issues. Our hope is that this program will give you an insight into your personality, your abilities, and into your possible achievements. In fact, physical training changes both your body and your spirit. In your efforts you become more determined and more confident in your abilities, and being confident is the key to success in different life areas, believe me.  There is a saying "if you want to change the world, start with yourself", and we can congratulate you with a great start.<br><br>


But <b>100 Days Workout</b> is just the beginning. Of course, you’ve improved your strength level and started to see the changes in your body, but we are sure that you would like to have more, which means that new goals should be set and new ways to achieve the goals should be found. Fortunately, we live at the time of information technologies, and the Internet offers a lot of useful info of high quality. Here the important thing is to find reliable sources. We can guarantee that other people have already successfully passed through the things you want to go through and have shared their knowledge and experience with the world.<br><br>

By the way, it would be great if you could share your knowledge and experience with other people, your relatives, friends, acquaintances once the program is completed. You can even share it with strangers whom you see for the first time on the site (we know that some participants have already done that, and it’s great!). One of the key Street Workout principles is "each one teach one", that is why we share our knowledge with you, you can share it with others, and so on one by one like in a chain. And this really works, because every day adds more people who know about Street Workout culture! <br><br>


So, it is too early to feel nostalgic about the end of the program, we still have 1.5 week ahead, including TURBO block which is different from ADVANCED block just like ADVANCED block is different from BASIC block.
