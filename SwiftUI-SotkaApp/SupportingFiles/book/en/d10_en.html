Yesterday we began to discuss a very interesting and important topic concerning proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Today we continue this conversation, and the second important component of our food is on the waiting list.<br><br>


<h2>Fats</h2><br>


<img src="../img/10-1.jpg" alt="10-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Fats are part of all living tissues of our body, they generally determine their structure and normal functioning. The health of the skin, hair, appearance and well-being depends on fat. Our ability to resist infections is also dependent on enough fat level in the body.<br><br>


<h3>6 important functions of fats</h3><br>


1. They are included in the composition of all cell membranes.<br>
2. Fats promote the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and they are the element of the bile, without which digestion is impossible.<br>
3. Fats are almost inexhaustible source of energy for the body.<br>
4. They participate in the process of thermoregulation of the body and a number of defense reactions<br>
5. They improve the taste of food. In many ways, it is thanks to fats that we feel the taste of food (proteins have a neutral or even unpleasant taste, and almost all carbohydrates are sweet).<br>
6. They also built hormones (including cholesterol), moreover, there are hormones responsible for weight loss among them.<br><br>


Obviously, fats should be in our daily diet, because without them the body can not function normally. However, it’s not so simple. The fats we consume with food are made up of fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are of two types (chemical characteristic - the number of covalent links between the carbon atoms in the molecule): saturated and unsaturated.<br><br>

<b>Unsaturated fats.</b> Nowadays they are considered the most useful for your body. They can be monounsaturated (contained in olive oil, canola oil, olives, avocados, hazelnuts, pistachios, almonds, nuts macade, etc.) and polyunsaturated (they are found in various types of vegetable oils (sunflower oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil), fish (especially sturgeons and their caviar), seeds, etc.).<br><br>


Why are they considered to be useful? Because they increase the level of "good" cholesterol (high density lipoproteins, HDL), they are soluble and are not tend to release cholesterol into the sediment, and thus protect the vessels from atherosclerotic changes (ie are not atherogenic)) and reduce the level of "bad" cholesterol (low density lipoproteins, LDL,they are

slightly soluble and are prone to release the cholesterol crystals into the sediment and to the form atherosclerotic plaques in blood vessels, thereby increasing the risk of heart attack or ischemic stroke, as well as other cardiovascular complications).<br><br>


This kind of fats is considered useful, cause of increasing the level of “good” cholesterol (HDL) and reducing the “bad” cholesterol (LDL).<br><br>

Polyunsaturated fatty acids are not synthesized in the body – that is, we can get them only with food. At the same time there are no such products that have all kinds of fatty acids necessary for our body. Therefore, it is important to eat a variety of fat-containing products, while giving preference to food rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids.<br><br>


<b>Saturated fat.</b> Currently, they are considered generally bad and this is due to the fact that they increase the overall level of cholesterol, including "bad". In large quantities they are found in animal products (ham, pork lard, beef, butter, cheese, cocoa, coconut, coconut milk, coconut oil, cream, cream cheese, ice cream, lard, palm kernel oil, palm oil, game meat, sour cream, unskimmed milk).<br><br>


It is necessary to understand that this is not harmful fats and we shouldn’t exclude them from the diet completely (for example, our brain consists of saturated fats), but you need to be cautious while consuming them.<br><br>


<b>TRANS fats.</b> This is the most harmful type of fat. A striking example is spreads (liquid unsaturated vegetable fats are converted into solid saturated). They not only increase the overall cholesterol level, but also reduce the level of "good" cholesterol!<br><br>

If you wonder why they were created, the answer is simple as always - for the sake of money. The use of TRANS fats allows products to be stored longer on store shelves! By the way, it is TRANS fats that can be found in all that food that is considered harmful (fast food, chips, donuts, etc.), so be careful! Apparently, after all, this food is considered harmful mot without a reason<br><br>

Do you know what the recommended rate of consumption of TRANS fats is? Zero grams. Zero! Because the use of TRANS fats, even in small amounts, leads to increasing risks of heart diseases and other problems associated with high cholesterol levels.<br><br>

And remember: whether fats are "good" or "bad", they are still high-calorie substances, and excessive consumption leads to overweight. According to the World Health Organization, "excessive consumption" means more than 30% of the total diet.<br><br>


It’s over with fats! But there’s no time to relax: tomorrow we will talk about carbohydrates.
