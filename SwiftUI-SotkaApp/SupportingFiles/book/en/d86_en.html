 Judging by the requests on the Internet and the number of different articles on sites and in magazines a fairly large number of people is concerned with the question of the optimal training duration. Probably we should say a few words on this topic. It’s especially important as many are confused with the relatively short duration of training within the <b>SOTKA</b> program..<br><br>
 
 
 
The most important thing to understand about the duration of a workout is the fact that the duration is a consequence, not a goal. What does it mean? I’ll explain: the duration of your training is determined by the kind of exercises you do, the number of sets, the number of repetitions in the sets you perform, what pace you choose for each repetition, the rest time between sets/exercises, etc. And all this, in turn, is dictated by the level of your current fitness, your capabilities and the goals you set.<br><br>


Thus, it is impossible to give a definite answer to the question how much time your training should take, because it’s different for all people. That's OK. In addition to the factors (mentioned above) that you can control, other factors that you are not able to influence will surely be in your life. Some of them will set a rigid framework for the training duration, which you’ll need to fit in. Such things can happen as well<br><br>


Anyway, your training is not an amount of time spent at the sports ground. If you just come every day and sit for an hour on the bench watching others working, you’re unlikely to succeed. Your workout is a job, where you are "paid" not for the time, but for action. Therefore, you should think about doing more in a limited period of time (unless you are a happy schoolboy or a student, who has the amount of spare time close to infinity).<br><br>


And you should always keep in mind the results you’re looking for. It is not enough just to come to the sports ground and train. Because even if you run a circle at a highly fast pace, it is unlikely that you can run far away. You need to ensure that your training moves you towards the desired result. I have already mentioned this in one of the previous infoposts. The point is, you have to track your progress. If your training does not bring you closer to success, then you need to change something in it. And, well, the number of variations you can try is really large.<br><br>


There are two more points that we want to talk about as they are both quite important and are related to the subject matter directly. On the one hand, some people work too little to get results (we’ll talk later about really hard training giving a terrific effect), while on the other hand, some train too hard. It's truly a problem. We have already said that your muscles grow not during the training, but during the rest time after them. But training, you give the body a request for future growth. So if you don’t work enough, the body simply will not have a stimulus to grow. At the same time, if you train too long, it will also be counter-productive. If you want to lose weight, more muscles will allow you to burn more calories during your workout. Because muscles, unlike fat, work and consume energy. When the fat just lies idle moving along the sports ground with you.<br><br>


We hope that, despite the large number of letters and a chaotic way of explaining, we have managed to answer the question about the training duration.</div>
