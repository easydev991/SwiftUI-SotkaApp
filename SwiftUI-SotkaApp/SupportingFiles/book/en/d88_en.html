Anyone who has been doing sports for quite some time knows that after achieving a certain level of physical conditioning your progress gets on a plateu. You do everything you have been doing before, but you do not progress any futher. The number of reps remains the same, or you can’t lift a heavier weight. As if you hit an invisible barrier that you cannot break. To overcome this widespread phenomenon, such thing as periodisation was invented.<br><br>


Periodisation – is a method of organising trainings by arranging them into groups (cycles), that imply periodical modifications into the training templates (including training techniques, training volume, intensity of loads, etc.). The main goal of periodisation is to overcome the periods of stagnation, when you cannot improve a particular result for a long period of time. <br><br>


Initially periodisation used to be <b>linear</b> (one-way process towards increasing the load) and (as a rule) consisted of 3 stages:<br>
1. At Stage 1 (preparatory) the training loads were 75-85% of the current maximum with a gradual (2-4 weeks) increase to 90-95%.<br>
2. At Stage 2 (training) the training loads comprised 90-100% of the current maximum.<br>
3. At Stage 3 (peak) the training loads started to gradually grow from 100% to a new maximum.<br><br>


In other words, the sense of linear periodisation is to make a step forward at every stage, until you reach your goal. After that you make a few steps back and start again.<br><br>


However later it became clear that there is a much more efficient type of periodisation than linear.It is called <b>wave periodisation</b> (it is no longer one-way but rather a two-way process, i.e. the training loads increase and decrease alternately).<br><br>


Essentially, the purpose of a wave periodisation is to make 2 steps forward and 1 step back at every stage (the number of steps is just an example). This way you will progress more efficiently compared to linear periodisation.<br><br>


<b>Ways of alternating training volume:</b><br>
1. Increasing the number of reps<br>
2. Increasing the number of attempts<br>
3. Increasing the training rate<br><br>


<b>Ways of alternating the intensity of training:</b><br>
1. Decreasing the period of rest<br>
2. Increasing the tempo<br>
3. Adding additional weight<br><br>


Besides, we should look at the periodisation globally. Let’s highlight 10 physical parameters of human body, that we can train:<br><br>

1. Strength;<br>
2. Endurance;<br>
3. Agility;<br>
4. Power (how fast you can attain the appropriate strength level);<br>
5. Speed;<br>
6. Coordination;<br>
7. Balance;<br>
8. Accuracy;<br>
9. Agility;<br>
10. Respiratory and cardiovascular systems capacity.<br><br>


It is obvious that some of them cannot be trained simultaneously. For instance, you can’t train strength and balance or accuracy together. To increase your strength, you need, for example, to increase the training load of a particular exercise. For that purpose, you should master the exercise, your muscles should work in proper coordination, etc. From the point of view of balance and coordination, this exercise does not contribute to your progress and so on. That is why it makes sense to develop these parameters in turns, splitting your yearly (for example) training into periods, each of them focusing on a particular parameter (and maintaining the rest if possible).<br><br>


Talking about periodisation, the following notions are used to describe the duration of different periods. Let’s study the main terms that we use to explain the basics of periodisation.<br><br>


<b>Training session</b> - a single training, during which you complete particular objectives, such as increasing strength or muscular hypertrophy.<br><br>


<b>Microcycle</b> — a combination of 2-6 training sessions. In other words, a microcycle consists of several training days (up to 7). Its purpose is to both complete particular objectives and recover (you decrease your loads) or “shock” your body.<br><br>


<b>Mesocycle</b> — a combination of several microcycles. Completing a 2-month training programme is a mesocycle that consists of 8 microcycles. Your particular objectives of building up strength and weight, skills practicing, etc. are completed with best efficiency during a mesocycle.<br><br>


<b>Macrocycle</b> — a combination of several mesocycles. The end-point of a macrocycle is to achieve your final goal.<br><br>

In the end of this week we will have a practical lesson dedicated the process of implementing periodisation in you onw training programm!
