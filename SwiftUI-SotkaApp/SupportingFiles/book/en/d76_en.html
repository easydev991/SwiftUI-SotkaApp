Muscles are the main driving force of our body, their contractions and relaxation move the skeleton bones. Therefore, when speaking about training, muscles are the first thing we should think about. But muscles are not the only components in our body. For example, tendons attach the muscles to the bones, while the joints are the moving connections with the moving bones inside and are surrounded by the ligaments. And to minimize the risk of getting injured during your training session, you should be aware of these things. <br><br>


<h3>What are we talking about?</h3><br>


<b>Ligaments</b> — are elastic connections between the bones, which stabilize the joints and don't let them move in "wrong" directions.<br><br>


The tissues of the ligaments and tendons consist of collagenic and elastic fibers. The first ones are responsible for the durability of the ligaments, while the second ones provide elasticity, which is quite evident from their name. However, there are more collagenic rather than elastic fibers in tendons and in ligaments.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">Collagen</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Basic protein for the connecting tissues of the body (tendons, bones, cartilages, derm, etc.) which gives strength ad elasticity to the tissue.</div></div><br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">Elastin</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Resilent protein which can significantly stretch (a relative deformation is 200-300%).</div></div><br><br>


However, it should be noted that the amount of collagen and elastin in the connecting tissue can significantly differ from person to person, depending on body type and age. This, for instance, determines more or less the "initial"  flexibility of a person.<br><br>


The ligaments are elastic, thus they can stretch when the joints move. But when someone say “I have sprained a ligament” the idea of this statement is different. Because when the ligaments stretch within their natural amplitudes, you may not even notice that. While when you feel the pain, it means that for some reasons the ligaments have to exceed their natural amplitudes. In this case they overstrain themselves, and their recovery takes too much time up to several months. Therefore, you should pay attention to ligament injuries as much (or even more) as to the fractures!<br><br>


<b>Tendons</b> — are a part of the muscle which connect a muscle to a bone. The main aim of a tendon is to transfer the efforts from the muscles to the bones. This is a must for any movement effort of a person.<br><br>


Tendons consist of thick, parallel arrays of structural elements packed closely together – fibrils which are composed of collagenic fibres. The main feature of a collagen is high resistance to rupture and slight relative deformation.<br><br>


Mechanical properties of ligaments and tendons depend on their size and composition. The more cross section is and the higher share of collagenic fibres there is, the higher their resistance to rupture is. It should also be noted that hormone level and agility impact the strength of the ligaments and tendons. Immobilization significantly decreases the strength of the ligaments and tendons. <br><br>


The important point is that in many cases tendons are stronger than their connections to the bones. This is why in most tendon injuries it is not the tendon it self which was ruptured, but rather the attachment to the bone. Regular training result in callus formation and bone overgrowth at the places where tendons are attached to the bones, thus extending their contacting area, but the speed of this process is relatively slow in comparison to the increase in muscle strength. Therefore, if you force the development of speedd-strength properties of the muscles, there could appear inconsistency between increased abilities of muscles and insufficient strength of the tendons and ligaments. And this could lead to injuries.<br><br>


<h3>Ligament training</h3><br>


At the moment we have not enough information about ligament training (and generally speaking, about this area and an independent workout session to train ligaments). If any of the participants has any information, please share it in the comments!<br><br>


<h3>Tendon training (myth!)</h3><br>


Everyone who has ever got interested in tendon training comes across the name – Alexander Ivanovich Zass, also known under the name of Iron Samson. It was him who at the beginning of the XXth century promoted an original system of static exercises with the chains. His epigraph was as follows: <i>“Muscles themselves won’t hold horses pulling in opposite directions, while tendons can, but they should be trained, and there is a method to train them”</i>. <br><br>


However, in reality the muscles give the strength, and they hold the horses pulling in opposite directions, while the tendons are responsible for transfering the strength from muscles to bones. To understand how it works, let’s look at the example with a tower crane. It is surely a simplified model which doesn’t count for some things, such as nervous innervation and reflexes, but still it is a model. In this case the analogies are as follows:  a steel wire rope is a tendon, and an engine is the muscles. The engine power will determine whether a crane can lift a load. And a rope will still experience a load no matter whether a crane lifts a load, or a load will just hang on a rope.<br><br>


Zass was wrong in his beliefs, because these are passive elements composed of connecting tissues, transferring efforts, while work involving strength is performed by applying the efforts, and these efforts are created by the muscles.<br><br>


<h3>Conclusion</h3><br>


Most fitness beginners only think about their muscles and don’t think much about other elements of their bodies which also experience training loads and which also need time for recovery. Not to have an injury (traumas of ligaments and tendons are very serious), you should listen to your body right from the very beginning and not to overload it, if you feel you are exhausted.
