We are going full speed towards the end of ADVANCED block and one more week is already left behind. This week was more about advanced general information and training knowledge that you would need after finishing our 100 Days Workout programm.<br><br>


But today new week begins and we are going to learn THE LAST and THE HARDEST advanced technique!!!<br><br>

		
<b><h3>Advanced techiniques are the ways to bring complexity and variety into our programme. If the standard technique is enough for you at the moment just keep it that way for a time being.</h3></b><br>

You are free to add advanced techniques, such as unstable repetitions, into your workout. If the your physical level is enough then you can use advanced techniques. If you find them too difficult or if you can't get the required number of reps, then don't include them now and just keep in mind these options for your futher training. Also you can intensify a single exercise, for example, only pull-ups or squats.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">Reminder!</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body"><b>1.</b> Keep rest periods between sets in each exercise WITHIN 60 seconds. That is, do the first pull-up set, have a minute rest, do the second pull-up set etc. At the same time a rest period shall not be less than 30 seconds. The rest period between exercises is SIMILAR.<br><br>


<b>2.</b> The number of sets in each exercise is 6, but since the work load has changed, we would recommend that you return to the starting number of reps in each set, and then increase it, if you find that too easy. Within the ADVANCED block it is very important to learn to assess your strengths.<br><br>


<b>3.</b> If doing an exercise or a set you can't perform the required number of repetitions, this set is considered to be the last for this exercise. THE MAIN THING is DO NOT WORRY IF IT HAPPENED!<br><br>


This limit is introduced mostly for you to be able to recover in 24 hours between training sessions to keep training every day. So if you fail to choose the right number of reps, (it is likely in the beginning), the limit will protect you from overtraining. At least that's what we expect.<br><br>


<b>4.</b> If you realize at some point that the ADVANCED block work load becomes excessive, you can always get back to your regular training and standard techniques for a few days. You can alternate the circuits and workouts based on doing sets, as well as standard and advanced techniques throughout the week. Anyway, you can have some creative input here as we all are different, and we still have too few statistics on the ADVANCED block to give you universal recommendations!</div></div><br><br>


<h3>TECHNIQUE: PLYOMETRIC TRAINING</h3><br>


One of the easiest ways to increase the training load while doing bodyweight exercises is to add explosiveness in your exercises. Todat we are going to show you plyometric technique, which increses the difficulty of any exercise via increasing range of motion and overcoming the gravity!<br><br>


Let's have a look on plyometric squats. You start in the standing position, then you squat down, as usual, and then you squat up, but in an explosive way, trying to make a jump. It is important that jump phase strats right from the very bottom, so your legs accumulate kinetic power during all the range of motion. Here is a video: <br><br>

				The same idea applies to push-ups and pull-ups:<br><br>
