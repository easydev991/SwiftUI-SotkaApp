The first week of the <b>ADVANCED</b> block is behind now, so it's time to sum up the information we have learned. All in all, the last week was dedicated to improving our knowledge of the exercises we perform. We discussed pull-ups, squats, pushups and lunges, as well as the importance of listening to yourself and considering the results of the "scientific" researches critically. We also switched to a new type of training sessions as well.<br><br>


Today we start a new week, so it's right time to introduce a new technique of performing the exercises!<br><br>


<b><h3>SETS Training is a way to add intensity and diversify the program. If you feel that standard load is enough for you, you don't need to change anything in your workout.</h3></b><br>

You are free to add advanced techniques, such as pauses in the exercises, into your workout. If the your physical level is enough then you can use advanced techniques. If you find them too difficult or if you can't get the required number of reps, then don't include them now and just keep in mind these options for your futher training. Also you can intensify a single exercise, for example, only pull-ups or squats.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">NOTE!</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body"><b>1.</b> Keep rest periods between sets in each exercise WITHIN 60 seconds. That is, do the first pull-up set, have a minute rest, do the second pull-up set etc. At the same time a rest period shall not be less than 30 seconds. The rest period between exercises is SIMILAR.<br><br>


<b>2.</b> The number of sets in each exercise is 6, but since the work load has changed, we would recommend that you return to the starting number of reps in each set, and then increase it, if you find that too easy. Within the ADVANCED block it is very important to learn to assess your strengths.<br><br>


<b>3.</b> If doing an exercise or a set you can't perform the required number of repetitions, this set is considered to be the last for this exercise. THE MAIN THING is DO NOT WORRY IF IT HAPPENED!<br><br>


This limit is introduced mostly for you to be able to recover in 24 hours between training sessions to keep training every day. So if you fail to choose the right number of reps, (it is likely in the beginning), the limit will protect you from overtraining. At least that's what we expect.<br><br>


<b>4.</b> If you realize at some point that the ADVANCED block work load becomes excessive, you can always get back to your regular training and standard techniques for a few days. You can alternate the circuits and workouts based on doing sets, as well as standard and advanced techniques throughout the week. Anyway, you can have some creative input here as we all are different, and we still have too few statistics on the ADVANCED block to give you universal recommendations!</div></div><br><br>


<b><h3>TECHNIQUE: PAUSES IN EXERCISES</h3></b><br>


Today we are going to learn the technique which will intensify your exercises by combining dynamic and static components in a single repetition. The point is to make a pause for 1-2 seconds at the top/bottom point (depending on the exercise) in each repetition. If there is quite the number of reps, say, more than 20, one may make a 5-sec pause every 5 reps.<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">Why?</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body"><b>1.</b>Static tension trains the central nervous system, so that it continuously sends signals from the brain to the muscles. The longer the static tension is, the more durable and powerful signals the brain sends for the muscle fibers to work.</div></div><br><br>


 Let's consider the example of pull-ups. You are in the initial position. Then you pull up and hold for 1-2 seconds in the top position, and then you go down. The repetition is completed.<br><br>

Repetitions in pushups, squats and lunges are similar. In these exercises one can make a pause at the BOTTOM as well as at the TOP point. While at the top you MUSTN'T rest on the joints (i.e. fully straighten your elbows/knees). The muscles shall be in tension all along the exercise.<br><br>

				This technique is the simplest you are to learn in the <b>ADVANCED</b> block, that's why the number of repetitions in sets can be the same as in the <b>BASIC</b> block.
