The second week is coming to an end, and that means today you are going to have stretching and flexibility training instead of usual circuit training! But today’s infopost is about proper attitude to healthy lifestyle and nutrition – it will wrap up this week’s topics..<br><br>


<img src="../img/14-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br>


Many people view diet as a burden, with limits to amount and flavours of food, but this burden is key to being slim and attractive. However, you should keep in mind that the word “diet” is Greek, and its original meaning is close to what we call “lifestyle”. Here’s why it is important:<br><br>



<b>Your body is the reflection of your lifestyle.</b> And it looks just the way you live, no more, no less.<br><br>


Problem is that people, at least most of them, do not see that connection. They don’t realise that small actions they make regularly, and small decisions they take daily define the eventual result. Each time they decide to sleep a while longer instead of taking a walk or drink a soda instead of water at lunch, they make a step in the wrong direction, opposite to where they want to get.<br><br>


All these small things are habitual and indistinct separately, that is why no one notices them, but they are the ones that make up our lifestyle. So next time instead of looking in the mirror with discontent, just remember that it’s only the reflection. And you should switch your discontent from the consequences to the reason, targeting your lifestyle. Because visiting a sports ground or reviewing nutrition is fully in your hands, unlike lipolysis or accumulating fat.<br><br>


There are no secrets or hidden techniques of losing weight, you simply need to understand physiological processes behind it. The most brilliant is that these processes can be described with one simple formula, that we described in details in our previous infopost about balance of calories. Simply maintaining the balance between training and nutrition may yield excellent results.<br><br>


But that’s only half the problem. The real troubles begin when your grow dissatisfied with your appearance, but you are not willing to change your lifestyle. That is the time when our creativity skyrockets: you attempt to squeeze your new body into the old lifestyle, i.e. remove the discord: you have no time or desire to train, but decide to stop eating bakery and start twirling hula hoop at home. Or: you want to eat a lot, so you go only for vegetables. Or: you change your regular dinner for a glass of water in phantom hope of losing weight. And then you decide to do the same in the morning to facilitate the process even more. Smaller number on the weights brings you joy. However, it is no less stupid, than to sit on absolute diet looking at the picture of a fitness-model hanging on the fridge. You can fool yourself for some time, but the lifestyle will prevail eventually and bakery will take its place on the plate instead of diet food.<br><br>


If you aren’t ready or willing to change your lifestyle, you should put aside your dreams of a sixpack or a trim butt before you start losing your hair from a nervous breakdown caused by figure fluctuation on the weights.<br><br>

We should mention that a trained and an untrained body will look differently regardless of weight. Moreover, one cannot imagine an attractive body without well-developed muscles (that concerns both genders). And muscles developed under loads, which we will discuss in details in our ADVANCED section. The length of your legs doesn’t depend on whether you like running or not, unlike the size of your bottom. Unfortunately, many young girls forget about it succumbing to torment with diets and not paying attention to physical training. You could have seen these girls, thin as a plank, but with a flappy bottom, which is particularly visible when they are trying to sit or bow. All of it is due to the lack of training.<br><br>


And finally, when you meet someone whose appearance you start to envy and play down your achievements, you should try to realise how much effort was dedicated to that. Years of training and active lifestyle, attention to their nutrition (daily cooking instead of processed food from the supermarket and lunches in the canteen) and daily routine are behind it all. Are you ready to invest in yourself to achieve the same results in due time? We will tell about it later.<br><br>


OK, enough with the lyrics, let’s go back to our 100DW program and see what it consists of. You already know that it consists of 3 blocks: <b>BASIC</b> (day 1 to 49), <b>ADVANCED</b> (day 50 to 92) and <b>TURBO</b> (day 92 to 98).<br><br>


We are at the very start, in the <b>BASIC</b> block. The first week was entirely about getting to know basic exercises (that the training part of our program is based on) and organizing your training process. The entire second week was about another important issue of proper nutrition. If you don’t get your nutrition right, then no amount training will shape you up! The next week will be fully dedicated to clarifying issues, which novices face as they start this program (how to breathe properly, how to learn pull up from scratch, etc.)<br><br>


This will be the end of compulsory part of the <b>BASIC</b> block and starting from day <b>22</b> to <b>50</b>, we will begin publishing infoposts for general purposes, FAQs, where you will find answers to all (for real) of your questions.<br><br>


We will revise the issues of <b>TRAINING</b> and <b>NUTRITION</b> in the <b>ADVANCED</b> block, when we will analyse the exercises thoroughly in terms of muscle loads (we want to be strong and healthy and attractive as well). In this block, we will update our training routine, add some street workout spirit and our daily infoposts will become more sophisticated.<br><br>


Finally, the <b>TURBO</b> block will become the trial, testing your skills – during the final week you will get a new interesting task every day. <br><br>


This is our plan for the near future, so keep going, it will be very fun!<br><br></div>
