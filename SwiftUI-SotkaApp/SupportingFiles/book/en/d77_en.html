For today, we have prepared a parable for you!<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">PARABLE</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Once one traveler was walking along a dusty road and right after the turn he saw a dusted man exposed to the sun and scabbling a huge stone. This man was scabbling and bitterly crying.  <br><br>


The traveler asked him why he was crying, and the man told him that he was the unhappiest person in the world, and he had the most difficult work in the world. He had to scabble the huge stones every day to earn just a dab of money which could be only paid for food. The traveler gave him a coin and moved further and...<br><br>


...after the next turn of the road he saw one more man who was also scabbling a huge stone, but he wasn’t crying rather was concentrated on the process. And the traveler asked him what he was doing, and a scabbler told him that he was working. Every day he came to this place and scabbled his stone. This was a difficult job, but he was happy with it as the money he earned was enough to feed his family. The traveler complimented him, gave him a coin, went further, and ...<br><br>


...after the next turn he saw one more scabbler who was in dust and under the sun, and he was scabbling a huge stone and was singing a joyful, happy song. The traveler was amazed. “What are you doing?!!” he asked. The man raised his head, and the traveler saw his happy face. <br><br>


“Don’t you see? I am building a school!”</div></div><br><br>


Why is this parable here? Well, when you come home after work exhausted and understand that you have no desire and mood for workout, then you should need more serious and precise motivation, than just to understand that workout is good for your health and all that stuff.<br><br>


At these moments we recall this parable about school. In this case school is a metaphor representing the result we would like to achieve. You can say that every workout session is a kind of a brick which you put into your ‘school’.  By putting your bricks regularly you can achieve your goal. This is how it works. But that’s not all. <br><br>


The parable above clearly illustrates that, in fact, our life is to a larger extent determined by our comprehension rather than by what it really is. We like to say that every situation has two ways out: you change the situation or change your attitude to it. However, we refer this statement to our work, not to our workouts, but still the idea is the same. If you want to achieve success, you should love this stuff, you should find the true meaning in it. <br><br>

 When we just started training on the streets our primarily goals were to have strength, beauty (aesthetics) and health. These goals are surely good. But now we have one more goal – we would like to become an example for other people to follow and to show what workout can help to achieve.  We clearly remember our first impressions about the guys from Wingate Park. They were not professionals or fitnessists, they perceived their sessions as a hobby and trained with friends and acquaintances in parks in the evenings. But at the same time they were well-built, strong and possessed good imagination in terms of exercises and combinations.  And we are not talking about some complex or spectacular exercises. We are talking about interesting and efficient exercises. Workout started with their ideas, although today many of us forget and even don’t know about them. <br><br>


 So, we mean that it is not easy to force yourself into training at midnight after a busy day only for being healthy and strong. But when your goal is more precise, it gives energy! We recommend you to find this high goal for your workout sessions, which will empower you for training at the time when you are exhausted or have no wish to do it.
