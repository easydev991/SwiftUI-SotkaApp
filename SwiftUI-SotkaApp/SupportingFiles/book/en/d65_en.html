We are certain that many of you have been waiting for this infopost for a long time. It is because today's topic is very, very popular on the internet. And as the title says - we are going to talk about increasing the number of pull-ups. Right from the start I have to say that there’re no secrets, only hard work! But this is the whole point itself!<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote"><div class="bbcode_quote_head">IMPORTANT!!</div><div class="bbcode_quote_body">Information in all infoposts of this week is provided for the informational purposes only. We do recommend you to use this new knowledge only AFTER finishind the 100DW programm.</div></div><br><br>


If you read forums or sites or social networks, then you will also have a persistent feeling that 20 pull-ups is a real deal, which separates those who train really hard from all other people. Indeed , many people out there can do 15-16 pull-ups, even 18-19 reps, but many times less guys can do more than 20 repetitions.<br><br>


<b><h3>General Tips</h3></b>


<b>Tip #1.</b> If you want to increase the maximum number of pull-ups, you must train your maximum! After certain level it’s really difficult to enlarge the number of pull-ups without direct maximum pull-up training session. Doing pull-ups for maximum reps is related not only with particular physical, but also mental attitude.
<br><br>


When you get close to 20 pull-ups, you get understanding that you can do 1 or 2 more pull-ups if you just hang for a while on a bar and let your muscles rest a little bit. This is called strengh endurance, guys. So dont jump of the bar right away after you can't get more reps (the mistake a lot of people do), instead, hang on for a while and try to do more. Still keep correct technique and no swinging.<br><br>


<b>Tip #2.</b> Do not set any limitations in front of you, or (if you still do) deliberately overstate them. Did you know that sprinters never set a goal to stop before the finish line? Because that way they will start to slow down too early thus losing speed and getting worse results. Exactly the same logic is in our case! Do you want to make 20 pull-ups? Set a goal to 25 or 30, maybe you will not achieve it, but you will definitely be able to do more than 20!<br><br>


<b>Tip #3</b> Always do clean pull-ups, strictly according to the technique! Legendary Zef said once: "I do my last pull-up exactly with the same ideal technique as the first one. If I cannot do it with perfect technique then I just don’t pull-up at all." Don't try to help yourself with swinging or kipping, because pull-ups is a strength movement! Got exhausted? Pull yourself together and do at least one more repetition! Better - two! You must pull up as long as you have power to. You've ran out of power? Pull yourself up as high as you can and hold at this point for a while, then go down. Every one of these little steps will bring you closer to the end goal!<br><br>


<b><h3>Different Training Approaches</h3></b>


 In general we can tell you about 3 ways, which will lead you to your goal of increasing the number repetitions and overcoming the barrier of 20 reps. They both were checked by me personally, and they both are working.<br><br>


<b>Method FIRST (maximum reps).</b> The main idea is to cut down the resting time between the attempt to the minimum (45-60 seconds), but still making every attempt to the maximum.<br><br>


Start with a warm-up sets and gradually increase the number of reps, and when you can’t raise the bar anymore - do it to the maximum. The number is entirely individual and depends on your physical conditions, but the point is in raising the number of reps in each attempt with every training. If your maximum was 10, you should aim for 50 pull-ups in total from all sets. It is a random number, a starting reference point. It is important to do the maximal number of reps with each attempt. You should get down when you simply can’t do one more pull-up, i.e. you make half the rep and you can’t go further up. In other words, do it till you drop<br><br>

<b>Method SECOND.</b> It can be narrowed down to appointing a day when you will do a “ladder” to the maximum and try to beat your best results. Do not try to reach your maximum without warming up – practice shows that it’s better to complete 1-2 warm-ups first, and then go breaking bad. Thus, you will improve your results and avoid injuries. But you should do really a lot of maximum attempts. We made 10 attempts per training.<br><br>


We should notice that this method must NOT be used during cold seasons, because it requires long periods of rest (10-15 minutes) between attempts, and your muscles will relax and the efficiency will drop significantly.<br><br>


<b>Method THIRD (5 sets method).</b> When you want to raise the number of reps in such difficult exercise like pull-ups (although this applies to any exercise), you should realise that even 1 extra rep to a maximum of 20, is a 5% increase! It’s like jumping across the Grand Canyon. What should we do if ”1” is the minimal increment when exercising with your own bidyweight? We can't we add half a kilo like in weight training, huh?<br><br>


Yes, we can! The main idea of this method is to reduce the increment. We do it by changing our attitude to maximum and distribute it into 5 sets, hence the name of the method. Instead of counting your maximum in 1 set, you can count your maximum in 5 sets in total, resting 4-3-2-1 minutes between sets correspondingly. For example, you counted that your peak was 20 reps (in 1 set), and if you do 5 sets, then you maximum is, say, 60 reps (20-15-10-5-5). At the next training you will try to add 1 rep to every set. In that case, it will be an increase of 1.7% instead of 5%, or actually even less if we mean the final attempt.<br><br>

Why we choose to do 5 sets? It’s totally random, it could be 3 or 7 – it is all up to you. We like number 5, it is a good number, that is why we talk about 5 sets. You can try out this method yourself, and you’ll be surprised that your maximum in the first attempt will increase in one month!<br><br>

<b><h3>How to cheat your brain?</h3></b>


As we mentioned before, doing over 20 pull-ups is not an entirely physical feat. We used to believe that 20 is really a lot, we were able to do 10-15, but then our strength vanished and each next pull-up was extremely difficult (sounds familiar, isn’t it?). Here’s a few tricks that can help you turn the tide:<br><br>


<b>Countdown.</b> How do we count usually? 1,2,3 etc. As a result with every rep, the number grows bigger and bigger and it puts pressure on us. As a result, we are already exhausted when approaching 20 (after 17, 18 and 19). Try counting down! Start with 20 and decrease the number with every rep, i.e. 20, 19, 18, 17 etc. At the end you will name veeeeery small numbers (5,4,3,2,1) and you will find it easier to pull up!<br><br>


<b>Divide whole into parts.</b> 20 pull-ups are no small number, whereas almost anyone can do 5 or 10. Make use of perception and partition 20 into 4 by 5 or 2 by 10, counting within this range. The effect will be the same – you will find it easier to pull-up!<br><br>


In conclusion, we have this to say. Many people say that you have to use weights to increase the number of pull-ups, or ask for a partner’s assistance to finish the reps. We used neither. We learned to do 30+ pull-ups relying on our own bodyweight. If you want to do many pull-ups you need to have a strong grip (you will have to hang a lot), strong and durable muscles (arms and back), and don’t forget about your spirit, because you will achieve your goal only if you believe in yourself!
