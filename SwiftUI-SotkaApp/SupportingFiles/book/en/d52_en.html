In our second infopost in ADVANCED block we will give you some more information about basic bodyweight exercises. And today we are going to talk about squats (once again).<br><br>


Squat - is a key exercise for lower body training, but unlike pull-up very little people make any changes to traditional squat technique and try any new variations. But our legs are made of a lot of musscles and the only way to activate them all is to combine different stances and feets placement. That's what we are going to talk about today.<br><br>


Firsly, no mattter what squats variation you are going to do, you should always be focuse on doing them with the proper technique. Don't forget to keep tension in your body, and do squats in comfort range of motion (around 90 degrees). We would also recommend you not to fully extend your legs in the upper part of the movement to prevent from shifting weight from muscles to joints. <br><br>


Secondly, in regular squats your feets are placed on the shoulder's width (plus/minus), your toes pointing forward. This is the place to start because in this position you have balanced weight load on your hips. If you want to shift the training a little bit and focus it on particular leg muscles, then you have to make some adjustments. If you turn your ties inwards then you would increase the load on the muscles on the outer side of the hips. Respectively, if you turn toes ourwards then you would increase the load on the muscles on the inner side of the hips. Plus, you are not limited to only these 3 positions (straight, inward, outward), moreover you have a full continuum of possible positions.<br><br>


Let's move on and discuss the legs position. By changing the distance between legs you can also switch the load from muscles om the outer side of the hip to the muscles on the inner side. You can also shift the load between hips and glutes. In standard position (feet on the shoulders width) load is balanced between leg muscles some what evenly. If you increase the distance between legs - you will shift the load toward glutes. In opposite case (if you place feets closer to each other) you shift the load toward hips. The ultimate squat variation for hips muscles is one when you place your feet next to each other. This variation is quiate difficult to perform without support, so oftenly it is executed standind back to the wall and using wall as an assistance.<br><br>


Thirdly, pistol squats. We suggest that pistol squats (or pistols) - is a really tough exercise which is not that effective for building muscles (but it is great for building strength). This is widely connected to the fact that you have to balance your whole body on one feet, which could be challenging, and because of that balance issue it is really difficult to perform pistols intense enought to make muscles grow. So if you search for illateral exercise we would better suggest you to try lunges.<br><br>


That's all for today! Keep squatting and training your leg muscles, because it is the foundation you are building on! And tomorrow we will talk about <b>push-ups</b>.
