Here is <b>5 reasons</b> why you should start our <b>SOTKA</b> programm:<br><br>


<h3><b>1. Effective methodology</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\reasons-0.jpg" alt="reasons-0.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Sinceince 2013 when we first started more than 250 000 people have already participated in our program and provided us with a great amount of data which we have carefully analyzed. We constantly make changes and adjustments to the program to make it better and more effeicient considering the end results of our participants. <b>SOTKA</b> has already helped tens of thousands of people not only to become stronger, healthier and sexier, but also to get necessary knowledge in fitness and physical activity fields in general.</a><br><br>


Everyday participants will recieve an infopost, containing information on training, nutrition, popular questions, motivation, street workout and so on. Additionally participants will execute daily workout routines consisting of 3-4 exercises, perfomed one by one without rest. Our main goal is both to educate and train, and we want to provide you with a knowledge basis for your future solo training as well as physical basis.<br><br>

                            <b>SOTKA is divided into 3 blocks:</b><br><br>


1. BASIC (day 1 to day 49)<br>
2. ADVANCED (day 49 to day 91)<br>
3. TURBO (day 92 to day 98)<br><br>


While our program is designed for newbies, even experienced athletes could find a lot of new and useful information in second and third blocks!<br><br>


<h3><b>2. Train anywhere and anytime</b> </h3><br>


<img src="..\img\reasons-1.jpg" alt="reasons-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Our program is designed around bodyweight exercises which allows you to train almost anywhere and anytime and which makes our program suitable for almost everybody! A lot of people underestimate bodyweight training, but calisthenics exercises are great start for everyone, who want to get in better shape, especially with no training experience or after an injury. <br><br>


<h3><b>3. Author</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\reasons-2.jpg" alt="reasons-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


This program was created by <b>Anton Kuchumov</b> aka <b>WasD</b>, one of the founders of Street Workout subculture. he is not a professional athlete or fitness trainer, but a regular person, who spends most of his day in front of the computer desk and doesn't have much free time. But who is, despite of this, in great physical shape. He has found that bodyweight training and calisthenics might be an ultimate tool to become stronger, healthier and sexier and now he is ready to share his knowledge and experience with you.<br><br>
<br><br>



<h3><b>4. Feedback for everyone</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\reasons-4.jpg" alt="reasons-4.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


If you will have any questions during the program, you can always ask them via our Feedback button. We would do our best to answer your questions, to maximize the effectiveness of our program. But please remember that this is our hobby and we have limited free time to give answers. <br><br>


We want you to change your lives for better in the next 100 days and we will do our best to help you!<br><br>


<h3><b>5. Totally FREE</b></h3><br>


<img src="..\img\reasons-5.jpg" alt="reasons-5.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Our program is 100% free for participants, because our main goal is to help as many people as possible to transform their lives and to become better versions of themselves. In contrary to many other projects, we believe that <b>"KNOWLEDGE IS NOT A COMMODITY!"</b> and thus we would not try to sell you anything during the program, nor advertise anythings. You will get all the information you need and all you will have to do to get results is to apply this new knowledge.<br><br>


One may ask then - why would you do that all for free? The answer lies in the very philosophy of Street Workout - "each one teach one". This is the principle which has helped our subculture to spread across the globe in the very short terms of time. And now we have somethings to share with people, something that can make you better and through our <b>SOTKA</b> program we do that. The very fact that we have helped someone to change his or her life and become better - is the best gratification for us.
