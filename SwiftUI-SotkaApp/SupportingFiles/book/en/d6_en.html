<b>Every last day of the training week we will focus on the development of flexibility and stretching. The reasons why it is necessary and why stretching and flexibility are very important to health, you will learn from today's infopost. WE DON’T DO CIRCLES TODAY!</b><br><br>


Adequate and various physical loads enable us to strengthen our musculoskeletal system and avoid many problems caused by sedentary or inactive lifestyle. But muscle strength is only one side of the coin. The work on the development and maintaining of flexibility of our ligaments and tendons is not of the less importance.<br><br>


To say at once: the theme of flexibility has been widely studied by scientists as extremely important in sports. Those who want to understand it deeper; you can read, for example, the book "Science of flexibility" by Michael J. Wilson. Alter. Within SOTKA we will talk about flexibility only in general.<br><br>

<h3>What is the human’s flexibility?</h3><br>


<img src="../img/6-1.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


Flexibility is the ability of soft tissues surrounding joint to stretch, which allows the definite range of motion in the joint. It may be considered as overall (in general, individually), and in a particular joint (that’s more correctly),  as it is unlikely that anyone but gymnasts need to be flexible in the entire body at once. Usually when we talk about flexibility, we talk about the flexibility of certain joints.<br><br>


The difficulty is that it is hard to find objective criteria to estimate how well the flexibility of the particular person is developed. How one can measure flexibility? In degrees? In centimeters? And what is better: good mobility in all joints or some talent, giving the possibility of doing the splits right away? The answers to these questions are highly individual.<br><br>


<h3>What is mobility?</h3><br>

The concept of (joint) "mobility" lies very close to the flexibility. It is the maximum amplitude of the movement in a joint. It can be active (when the movement in the joint is carried out by contracting the appropriate muscles) and passive (when the external force is applied).<br><br>


<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">A joint (the explanation is simplified, we hope medics will forgive us for this casual treatment for the words here and below) is a movable coupling of two or more bones that are driven by muscles fastened to it. The bones in the joint can move in one plane, for example, the elbow joint, and to be driven by a pair of antagonistic muscles – biceps and triceps. And they can move in all planes, set in motion by a group of muscles, for example, rotation of the shoulder joint is responsibility of pectoral muscles, deltoid muscles, trapezoid muscles, the muscles of the rotator cuff, etc. With the years our joints deform under long-term impact of the environment.	</div></div><br><br>


Speaking of the joints mobility, we still mean the work with the muscles. There are that muscles, which are responsible for flexion and extension of individual joints, and which do not allow you to do the splits or to fold like a pocketknife. And the stretching of these muscles will improve your flexibility.<br><br>


<h3>How can we improve flexibility?</h3><br>

The answer is simple: to improve flexibility you need to stretch or as it is fashionable to say now, to do stretching.<br><br>


Physiologically our muscles are able to stretch great enough, elongating sometimes more than 50%. However, our nervous system at some point blocks stretching motion, as if to say, "Do not relax any longer! Caution! You can get hurt!". While stretching, you are training your nervous system, sending her additional impulses, which give the command to contraction and subsequent relaxation of the target muscles, allowing them to lengthen more and more.<br><br>

<div class="bbcode_quote">
<div class="bbcode_quote_head">:</div>
<div class="bbcode_quote_body">It is important to remember that stretching implies not the elongation and stretching of the muscles itself, but their controllable relaxation!</div></div><br><br>


It turns out that strength-training teaches our muscles to contract effectively, and stretching permits them to relax effectively. The combination of these two components in your training is the key to a healthy body.<br><br>


<h3>What’ll happen if you don't develop flexibility?</h3><br>

In childhood almost all of us are healthy and have not had time to acquire serious ills. We have strong bones, healthy heart, clean lungs, and our ligaments and tendons are flexible and mobile. But with age, our body starts to wear out because of constant impact of a variety of negative factors.<br><br>

A lot of bad happens to us, but we would like to focus more on our joints. For example, skeletal and muscular system of a typical office worker can obtain very specific features with years: hunched shoulders, bulging belly, flabby muscles.<br><br>

Why do we get all this "bonus" to the benefits package? That’s because our muscles, joints, ligaments and tendons have been "training" for a long time to in a one-sided and unbalanced training. And this leads to changes in our joints.<br><br>

The processes associated with immobilization (a decrease in the quality and quantity of the movements in the joint) always lead to the same result: decreasing of the soft tissues elasticity, worsening of the joint feeding (the cartilage tissue lacks blood vessels, so the nourishment arrives due to the blood supply of the surrounding muscles), degradation of nerve impulse transmission and, as a result, – reduction of mobility in the joint and decreasing muscle strength.<br><br>

The first illustrative example is stoop. Constant work at the computer holds the shoulder joints in such a position, when the muscles, those bring the shoulder in and forward, are contracted and are in tension all the time, and abductor-muscles, which get shoulder back, are strained. If the person is in such a state at work for years and if he doesn't perform any physical activity that would force the shoulder joint to work in the opposite direction, then he will get that same stoop, which appears due to the imbalance in the work of adductor and abductor muscles of the shoulder.<br><br>

Looking at this problem from the point of flexibility, it becomes clear that being a long time in the wrong sitting position, we reduce the mobility of the shoulder joints and disrupt the balance between the muscles-antagonists. The solution is stretching (stretching) the chest muscles (pectorals) and performing horizontal traction (pulling) exercises (for example, Australian pull-ups).<br><br>

The second vivid example is the pain in the lumbar. Our body suffers from a sedentary lifestyle in the following way. Constantly contracted, but not strained hamstring (the muscle in the back of the thigh) gets shortened over time. Meanwhile, on the contrary, the muscles of the lower back relax due to the fact that we usually do not keep our backs straight when we sit. After a while, the muscles become weak and stretched, which subsequently leads to pain in the back, as any more or less significant load for them is exorbitant. The solution of the problem in this case is stretching of the hamstrings and strengthening up the core muscles (for example, performing various types of plank).<br><br>


<h3>Benefits from training for increasing flexibility</h3><br>


<img src="../img/6-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img" /><br><br>


<b>1. The increase of the amplitude of motion in the joints</b><br><br>


Unfortunately, many people are unable to squat deep, keeping the heels on the floor. They lack flexibility and mobility at the ankle and hip joints. And the cut down amplitude of the exercise, in turn, reduces its effectiveness.<br><br>


<b>2. Improvement of the athletic characteristic</b><br><br>


With improving of flexibility, athletic characteristic are growing in general. However, untimely or improper stretching can sometimes reduce the results of your workout due to the relaxing effect.<br><br>


<b>3. Improvement of physical fitness</b><br><br>


At a certain very high stage athletes often have to sacrifice some qualities of their bodies in order to develop the other quality. But at the initial stage of training, the opposite is true: developing one physical quality you contribute to the development of all the rest. In our case, work on flexibility will improve strength by training the Central nervous system (CNS), which will give more accurate signals to your muscles. And it means you will be able to use your potential more effectively.<br><br>


<b>4. Reduction of tension and risk of injury</b><br><br>


Regular stretching allows you to restore the balance in various muscles, disrupted due to a sedentary lifestyle. Stretched muscles are less tense, and accumulate chronic fatigue in less degree, which means they're less prone to injury. Stretching improves blood circulation, increases elasticity of muscles, makes your body more resilient and strong.<br><br>


Actually "Stretching" doesn't mean muscle stretching, but it's controlled relaxation.<br><br>


<b>5. Correction of posture</b><br><br>


Permanent sedentary lifestyle and many hours of computer work lead to stoop and fault in posture. Systematic stretching of the spine and shoulder joints help to reduce the negative effect of the civilization achievements to a minimum.<br><br>

<b>6. Acceleration post-workout recovery </b><br><br>


Delayed onset muscle soreness is a occurrence of microtraumas in the muscles due to metabolic toxins accumulated there during the training. Stretching relaxes muscles, improves blood flow and leads to more rapid removal of these toxins from the muscles.<br><br>


<b>8. Improvement of the quality of life</b><br><br>


Everything is simple – it's nice to be able to tie shoelaces while standing in 10 years, and 40 and 80. And if you remember what the problems with the flexibility and range of motion older people have, you will agree, that stretching is a serious business!<br><br>

<h3>How to do stretching correctly?</h3><br>

There are different methods and ways of stretching of the muscles, which within the framework, we would recommend using static stretches (especially for inflexible and sedentary people) as the most simple and safe one.<br><br>

The bottom line is in this:<br><br>

1. Choose a muscle that you will stretch.<br>
2. Take the starting position and slowly stretch the target muscle to a state of slight discomfort, you can safely carry (not to endure the last effort, but to feel the tension and discomfort, NOT PAIN!).<br>
3. Stay for 30-60 seconds in this position. In the following process you can feel that you can pull a little more, do this movement and fix in this position.<br>
4. Within 30 to 60 seconds return to the starting position slowly. Breathe smoothly. It’s not necessary to hold your breath.<br><br>

This was one approach. Perform 2-3 sets on each muscle. Do all movements smoothly, choose the safest ones among the possible options(i.e. if there is an option to draw while standing or sitting, choose the sitting one)not to fall accidentally.<br><br>

Do stretching after your muscles are warmed up , after the stretching  do not make sudden movements some more time, at least 30-60 minutes, so as not to injure the "pull" muscles inadvertently. At first you will not be sufficient to hold your muscles properly while stretching, for example, the so-called "hamstrings". Instead of it you will strain the quadriceps, buttocks.<br><br>

Try to relax muscles during stretching, and not force other muscles to pull them. Although there are some techniques to stretch muscles through the efforts of others, but first learn to relax the muscles. The ideal time to stretch is in the evening, preferably at bedtime. In the morning the muscles are too "tight" through the night of dehydration and a higher viscosity due to their immobilization.<br><br>

Do not forget that to stretch can not only by the power of your muscles, but with the help of a partner or improvised things. The first and coolest assistant in the stretching is belt (if you do not reach any part of the body  to stretch properly)<br><br>


<h3><b>Flexibility: is it always good?</b></h3><br>


If a question was asked, there’s a need to look for the catch. And here really is. Mobility of the joints always comes in pairs with their stability, these are two interrelated features.<br><br>

Is it necessary to develop the flexibility excessively? Does a regular office worker need to be able to do the splits, to do a backbend, to touch his knees with forehead? Probably not.<br><br>

Do I need to increase the mobility of the hip, shoulder, ankle? Most likely, Yes.<br><br>

As you can guess, it all depends on lifestyle, age, profession and leisure. Yes, flexibility can be excessive and can even lead to certain health problems and discomfort. And certainly it makes no sense to increase flexibility, while not engaged in the exercise of the relevant muscles, able to manage ever-increasing range of motion. Too strong passion for stretching can even lead to dislocations and sprains.<br><br>

How to find out if your body is flexible? There are special tests for flexibility for specific joints by doing which, you can learn about the mobility of the body parts you need to work on.<br><br>

Well, that's all for today, we hope this post gave you enough of useful information!
