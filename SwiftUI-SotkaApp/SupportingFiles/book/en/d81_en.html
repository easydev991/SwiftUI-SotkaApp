Anyone who does enough time on horizontal bars and uneven bars sooner or later faces the fact that any of the joints in the body begins to crunch unpleasantly. Often this crunch does not cause pain, but it is slightly annoying. Why are joints crackling, is there any reason for concern here, what to do to protect them and why eminent chondroprotectors (glucosamine and chondroitin) do not work, we will talk about all this in today's infopost.<br><br>

<h3>Joint structure</h3><br>

<center><img src="../img/81-1-en.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br></center>

A very simplified joint can be represented as follows: two bones are connected by a movable joint, and each end of the bone is covered with hyanilin cartilage. The main task of this cartilage is to reduce friction and increase bone mobility in the joint. It has a porous structure (like a sponge) and contains a synovial (lubricating) fluid, which under stress releases into the joint. In addition, as you have already noticed, the ends of the bones are inside the joint capsule, which not only holds them together, but also produces synovial fluid.<br><br>

<h3>Main causes of joint problems</h3><br>

1. Excess weight. An obvious factor, because the more weight, the greater the load on the joints. Moreover, both static (for example, when we are sitting at a computer) and dynamic (for example, while running or jumping).<br><br>

2. Chronic infections Genitourinary or intestinal infections can cause joint problems, including arthritis. For example, simply eating a poor-quality shawarma on the street can cause problems. Any intestinal problems, acquired and congenital, can also create joint problems.<br><br>

3. Autoimmune problems.<br><br>

4. Hormones. Thyroid problems, such as hypothyroidism.<br><br>

<h3>Why do joints crackle?</h3><br>

The reason is the synovial fluid mentioned above. Rather, its lack. Maybe it is produced too little, or maybe we give such big loads that the body does not have time to supply it, or maybe there are any diseases of a degenerative nature. There can be many reasons, but the result is one - there is not enough lubrication in the joint and therefore it begins to crackle and creak.<br><br>

And this is much more dangerous than it might seem at first glance. In addition to the lubricating function, synovial fluid also plays the role of a nutrient medium for the joints, since the capillary system is not very developed in the joints, that is, they do not receive much nutrition from the blood.<br><br>

This is not only about the amount of synovial fluid, but also about its quality (that is, the composition of the materials of which it consists).<br><br>

<center><b>Synovial fluid = Proteins (proteoglycans) + Carbohydrates (glycosaminoglycans) + water</b></center><br><br>

For the full synthesis of glycosaminoglycans, the body requires a sufficient amount of the following three things:<br><br>

1. Glucose<br>
2. Glutamine<br>
3. Sulfur<br>

This, by the way, explains the fact that on various versions of keto diets, unpleasant sensations in the joints begin to appear. Because the amount of sugar in the body decreases and it becomes insufficient for the structure of the synovial fluid.<br><br>

The presence of sulfur in this list should not greatly surprise you, and, moreover, you do not need to rush headlong to the nearest pharmacy to get pills. Because a sufficient amount of sulfur can be obtained from the usual diet, for example, from a plate with buckwheat. But about this, and about how to maintain joint health, we will talk further. By the way, it is sulfur that is associated with the effectiveness of the use of glucosamine-chondroitin complexes from some sports nutrition manufacturers that have the MSM component in their composition. Because this mysterious MSM is nothing but MethylSulfonylMetane, that is, the very sulfur that the body needs. And it is precisely due to this additive that the whole complex works. While chondroitin and glucosamine, as were useless, have remained, but more on that below.<br><br>

<h3>Why do chondroprotectors (glucosamine and chondroitin) not work?</h3><br>

There are two main options in the form of which chondroprotectors can be purchased in modern pharmacies: in the form of creams / gels and in the form of additives. Neither option works. And this can be proved to you by any student who diligently attended biology classes. But since many adults have long forgotten everything, then let's figure it out again.<br><br>

First, let's look at what chondroitin (chondroitin sulfate) is?<br><br>


<center><img src="../img/81-2.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br></center>

With glucosamine, the situation is somewhat better, just look at its formula:<br><br>

<center><img src="../img/81-3.jpg" class="bbcode_img"><br><br></center>


These are long protein chains, and this is a very important point that we need to remember for later proof.<br><br>

Let's start with creams and gels, because their ability to "nourish" the joints by applying them to the skin from the outside is completely absurd.<br><br>

If our skin could pass such large molecules through itself into the body, then we could quite well use this organ for nutrition. For example, swallowing dinner by simply lowering your hand in a bowl of soup. Or rub sugar into the skin when we would like a little sweet. But the fact is that one of the main functions of the skin is protective (and NOT nutritious), and its task, precisely, is to NOT let anything superfluous inside.<br><br>

Therefore, you can safely throw away all your chondroitin creams, if any, and scold the last words of greedy pharmacists who profit from the simplicity of citizens. But there are still a variety of pills and supplements! Are they inside the body without problems, and therefore they can provide it with chondroitin and glucosamine?<br><br>

Unfortunately, or rather, fortunately, nature has created our body quite smart. Therefore, any protein or carbohydrate (absolutely any!), When ingested with food, will be broken down into simple elements (to amino acids or glucose) and the already obtained constituent parts will be used to create those protein structures that the body needs. Thus, it is not so important in what form you use protein, in the form of a piece of chicken or a specialized supplement, because the body will split it into components and will build its own proteins from them.<br><br>

That is, our body will by no means be able to use ready-made amino acid chains from tablets to build its own structures. First, it will destroy everything, and only then, subject to other factors, will be able to rebuild.<br><br>

And despite the fact that the manufacturers of additives know all this very well, this does not stop them from breathing in to trusting customers a “miracle” pill at fabulous prices, promising a solution to joint problems.<br><br>

<h3>Collagen for healthy joints!</h3><br>

When it comes to joints, in addition to talking about synovial fluid, one cannot but touch upon the issue of collagen. Of course, it is not directly related to the crunch of joints, because it is a structural protein, but since it makes up to 75% of all protein structures in our body, it is also very important. Its deficiency negatively affects not only the muscles and joints, but the sides of the skin (wrinkles), blood vessels (elasticity), intestines (gastrointestinal problems), eyes (blurred vision), etc.<br><br>


For the synthesis of collagen, building materials, of course, are a necessary, but not sufficient condition. This complex multi-stage process also needs various enzymes, vitamins and minerals, i.e. a whole spectrum of different substances. In particular, the synthesis of collagen requires hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. They are obtained from the amino acids of proline and lysine by the method of hydroxylation using vitamin C. Moreover, if the body does not have a sufficient amount of this vitamin, the hydroxylation process does not occur, the necessary substances are not synthesized, and collagen synthesis, which is so important for us, does not occur. needed.<br><br>

<b>What is needed for collagen synthesis?</b><br>

1. Vitamin C<br>
2. Vitamin PP (B3)<br>
3. Vitamin B6<br>
4. Copper<br>
5. Iron<br>
6. Vitamin P<br>

<h3>Gelatin Jelly Recipe</h3><br>

We want to immediately warn that this recipe is MUCH more effective than using ANY gelatin and collagen supplements. Therefore, it is unlikely that you will find it on other sites on the Internet that simultaneously advertise dietary supplement manufacturers.<br><br>

Ingredients:<br>
1. Jelly<br>
2. Rosehip<br>

Rosehips have a huge amount of useful substances, primarily flavonoids, which are very few in canned vitamin complexes from stores. Rosehip is also often called the "orange of the north", because the north it is grown, the more vitamin C.<br><br>

Unfortunately, whole rose hips are not suitable for our purposes because of the villi of plant origin inside them, which, when ingested, will irritate the mucous membrane. Therefore, we will use syrup based on rosehip extract or pure rosehip extract. The difference between them is that in the syrup the concentration of the active substance is lower (about 70%), and sugar is also added. But at the same time it can be found in any pharmacy, but you still have to look for a pure extract.<br><br>

<b>Cooking process</b><br>

The proportions should be observed as follows: 1 mass of dry gelatin per 5 masses of liquid, that is, if a standard bag of gelatin contains 10 grams of substance, then they will need to add 50 grams of liquid (water + syrup or just water, if the rosehip extract is dry )<br><br>

1. 10 grams of gelatin + 30 grams of water<br>
2. Put in the microwave for 10 seconds (when heated, the gelatin dissolves in water)<br>
3. Add 20 grams of syrup or extract (it is important to add AFTER heating, so that during the heat treatment of the substance from the dogrose, the same flavonoids do not deteriorate.<br>
4. Put in the refrigerator until freezing.<br>
5. Eat after meal.<br><br>

If you use dry rosehip extract, then add 1 gram of water in paragraph 1, and add 10 grams of extract in paragraph 3.<br><br>

It is also important to observe the ratio of water and gelatin to syrup / extract, because usually in the preparation of jelly a lot of water and a small amount of gelatin are used, which, from the point of view of functional use and usefulness, loses all meaning.<br><br>

Using a microwave instead of plain hot water is explained by the fact that the more you treat the gelatin, the more it will dissolve (this process is called protein denaturation), which means it will be easier to digest to your body.<br><br>

The norm for the consumption of these jellies is as follows - 1 jelly weighing 50 grams per 50 kg of weight, that is, 0.2 grams of gelatin per kilogram of weight. This will be enough to ensure daily collagen synthesis.<br><br>

IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER! That rose hips also have side effects that can adversely affect people with gastrointestinal problems or ulcers (due to the acidity of this jelly). Blood viscosity, Vitamin K contained in rose hips increases blood viscosity. Thrombophlebitis. Low / high pressure, in the first case, the rosehip lowers the pressure, in the second - it causes a sharp jump in pressure. Rosehip is also used to stimulate the biliary tract, so if you have problems in this area, it is best to consult with specialists.<br><br>

But, in general, in such dosages, there should not be any problems. This is NOT a REPLACEMENT of a nutritious diet, but an addition to the diet.
